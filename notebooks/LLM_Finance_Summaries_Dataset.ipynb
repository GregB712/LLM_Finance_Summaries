              " 'content': 'Apple “willfully chose not to comply” with a court order to loosen its app store restrictions—and one of its executives lied under oath about the company’s plans, a federal judge wrote on Wednesday. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has referred the situation to the US Attorney’s Office in San Francisco “to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.” In 2021, Gonzalez Rogers presided over a lawsuit brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games over the iPhone maker’s allegedly anticompetitive practices that hampered the ability of developers to generate revenue from the App Store. This included Apple’s policy of taking a 30 percent commission on certain in-app purchases. While Gonzalez Rogers ultimately ruled in favor of Apple on most counts, she ordered the company to begin allowing developers to market ways to make in-app purchases outside of the App Store ecosystem. Apple responded by lowering its commission to 27 percent on purchases made elsewhere, but it also introduced a series of other changes, including showing so-called scare screens, to dissuade users from making purchases outside its ecosystem. Last year, Epic challenged in court how Apple was responding to the order, leading Gonzalez Rogers to require the tech giant to turn over documents that contributed to Wednesday\\'s contempt ruling. Apple pursued its noncompliance strategy “with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote in her ruling on Wednesday. “That it thought this court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation.” She also said that Apple executives tried to hide the real motivations for the changes. “In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,” Gonzalez Rogers said. She went as far as accusing Alex Roman, a vice president of finance at Apple, of lying during testimony in which he talked about how Apple came to its decision to go with a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside the App Store. “The testimony of Mr. Roman was replete with misdirection and outright lies,” the judge said. “We strongly disagree with the decision,” Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton said in a statement to WIRED. \"We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.\" Roman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citing internal Apple documents from 2023, Gonzalez Rogers said Apple’s App Store chief Phillip Schiller “had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction” but that CEO Tim Cook “ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.” The judge demanded that Apple immediately comply with her earlier order. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation,” she wrote. “There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition.” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on X that the new ruling would bring an end to “Apple’s 15-30% junk fees.” Update 4/30/25 10:00 ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Apple.

        "\n",
        "  * JSONL: Each article and its summary are stored on a separate line. This makes it much faster and easier to process large datasets because you can read and parse each line independently.\n",
        "  * JSON: The entire dataset is stored as a single, large JSON object. This can become very slow and memory-intensive to work with when dealing with many articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Ease of Streaming:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * JSONL: Its line-by-line structure makes it ideal for streaming data. You can start processing articles immediately as they're read, without having to load the entire dataset into memory first. This is crucial for very large datasets that might not fit in memory.\n",
        "  * JSON: Requires loading the entire file into memory before processing, which can be problematic for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Flexibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * JSONL: Each line can have a slightly different structure if needed, as long as it's valid JSON. This can be useful when dealing with data that has variations or optional fields.\n",
        "  * JSON: Requires a strict, consistent structure for the entire dataset."
