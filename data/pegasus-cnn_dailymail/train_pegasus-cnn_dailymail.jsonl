{"text": "Apple \u201cwillfully chose not to comply\u201d with a court order to loosen its app store restrictions\u2014and one of its executives lied under oath about the company\u2019s plans, a federal judge wrote on Wednesday. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has referred the situation to the US Attorney\u2019s Office in San Francisco \u201cto investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\u201d In 2021, Gonzalez Rogers presided over a lawsuit brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games over the iPhone maker\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive practices that hampered the ability of developers to generate revenue from the App Store. This included Apple\u2019s policy of taking a 30 percent commission on certain in-app purchases. While Gonzalez Rogers ultimately ruled in favor of Apple on most counts, she ordered the company to begin allowing developers to market ways to make in-app purchases outside of the App Store ecosystem. Apple responded by lowering its commission to 27 percent on purchases made elsewhere, but it also introduced a series of other changes, including showing so-called scare screens, to dissuade users from making purchases outside its ecosystem. Last year, Epic challenged in court how Apple was responding to the order, leading Gonzalez Rogers to require the tech giant to turn over documents that contributed to Wednesday's contempt ruling. Apple pursued its noncompliance strategy \u201cwith the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers wrote in her ruling on Wednesday. \u201cThat it thought this court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation.\u201d She also said that Apple executives tried to hide the real motivations for the changes. \u201cIn stark contrast to Apple\u2019s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said. She went as far as accusing Alex Roman, a vice president of finance at Apple, of lying during testimony in which he talked about how Apple came to its decision to go with a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside the App Store. \u201cThe testimony of Mr. Roman was replete with misdirection and outright lies,\u201d the judge said. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the decision,\u201d Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton said in a statement to WIRED. \"We will comply with the court\u2019s order and we will appeal.\" Roman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citing internal Apple documents from 2023, Gonzalez Rogers said Apple\u2019s App Store chief Phillip Schiller \u201chad advocated that Apple comply with the injunction\u201d but that CEO Tim Cook \u201cignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.\u201d The judge demanded that Apple immediately comply with her earlier order. \u201cThis is an injunction, not a negotiation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition.\u201d Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on X that the new ruling would bring an end to \u201cApple\u2019s 15-30% junk fees.\u201d Update 4/30/25 10:00 ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Apple.

{"text": "Visa has reportedly offered to hand over $100 million to Apple in order to take over payment processing for its credit card, replacing Mastercard. The offer comes as Apple is in the process of replacing Goldman Sachs as the issuing bank of Apple Card after that company decided to get out of the consumer lending business. The offer was reported on Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal, which says that American Express is among others trying to win the deal; Mastercard is trying to retain the business. Credit card processors like Visa and Mastercard communicate transactions between the bank of the customer and the retailer and take a small cut of each transaction. Visa previously threw out cash to become the payment processor for Costco\u2019s credit card. Apple introduced its credit card back in 2019 as a way to increase loyalty and generate a new stream of revenue. It does this by taking a cut of those transaction fees as well as slicing off a portion of earnings from the high-yield savings accounts it offers through Goldman. Goldman reportedly decided to end its relationship with Apple because it was bleeding cash by offering the card to customers with low credit scores, something Apple had demanded. It also could not charge annual fees for the Apple Card, something many premium credit cards come with these days. Goldman was desperate to get into consumer lending during the pandemic, and Apple essentially fleeced the bank. Still, the WSJ reports that Apple Card customers are carrying $20 billion in balances, suggesting whoever takes over the business could stand to earn a lot of money if they can manage it better than Goldman. Financial companies are also worried that Apple could further cut them out of the business if it decides to take control of even more of the payments stack; Apple traditionally likes to control every aspect of its products: But there\u2019s a much bigger picture with Apple. The tech giant is increasingly becoming the epicenter of many consumers\u2019 daily payments and other financial habits. Big banks and networks for years have been wary of Apple\u2019s ambitions and have developed a frenemy relationship, taking steps to keep the tech giant from making more inroads in consumer finance, while seeking to be close to Apple. The network that locks in this deal is expecting to stay close to Apple\u2019s future payments efforts. Late last year, Apple and Goldman were hit with an $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over problems with the roll-out of the Apple Card, including poor customer support and unclear terms for its zero-interest finance deals on purchases of items from Apple\u2019s website. The CFPB reported that cardholders assumed all purchases from Apple.com made using the card were eligible for zero-interest financing, when in fact cardholders needed to use the Safari browser and select a specific option at checkout the get the deal. Apple\u2019s credit card is a fine product, but there are other credit cards on the market that offer better perks\u2014and do not require cardholders to use an iPhone. Apple forces customers to use Apple Pay in order to get 2% cashback on spend ; using the physical card only earns 1% cashback. The card also does not offer perks of other cards, like purchase protection or access to exclusive lounges. The fact of the matter is that there are a multitude of other credit cards out there that offer the same exact cashback as Apple Card in addition to other benefits and do not leave users locked in the Apple ecosystem.

{"text": "In a scorching ruling against Apple, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Wednesday accused an Apple finance executive of providing false testimony under oath during the company's ongoing legal battle with Epic Games. The judge stated that Alex Roman, Apple's vice president of finance, gave testimony that was \"replete with misdirection and outright lies\" regarding when Apple decided on its controversial 27 percent commission fee for purchases made outside the App Store. \"Contemporaneous business documents reveal that on the contrary, the main components of Apple's plan, including the 27 percent commission, were determined in July 2023,\" wrote Gonzalez Rogers in her ruling. \"Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies.\" The ruling is significant enough that Gonzalez Rogers is referring the case to a U.S. attorney for possible criminal contempt proceedings against both Apple and Roman. The reduced 27 percent fee  was established after the 2021 Epic Games lawsuit ruling. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected claims that Apple operated a monopoly. However, she ruled that Apple's anti-steering conduct was anti-competitive, and ordered the company to allow developers to link to alternative payment methods outside the App Store. Apple complied by creating a system where developers can apply for a \"StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement\" to direct users to external payment options. However, Apple still demands a 27% commission on these transactions made within seven days of clicking the link. That's set to change though after Wednesday's ruling. The court now says Apple cannot collect any fee or commission for purchases that consumers make outside of an app, nor can it track, audit, or monitor consumer activity. The judge didn't mince words in her assessment of Apple's behavior, writing that \"Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court's Injunction\" and did so \"with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers\" to maintain its revenue stream. \"That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,\" she added. \"As always, the cover-up made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple.\" The false testimony appears to have particularly aggravated the judge, who said in her ruling that the alleged deception compounded Apple's original violation of the anti-steering injunction. In a brief statement, Apple said: \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\" Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

{"text": "Apple stock dropped 4% in early Friday trading, broadly following yesterday's trend after China announced reciprocal tariffs in response to U.S. President Trump's trade policies. The latest decline follows Thursday's dramatic 9% plunge that erased nearly $300 billion from Apple's market value \u2013 the company's worst single-day performance in five years \u2013 amid growing fears that Trump's trade war will hurt the global economy. Apple's market value was expected to be reduced further today as markets processed China's matching 34% tariff announcement. China's finance ministry announced it would impose a matching 34% tariff on U.S. imports starting April 10, one day after Trump's new duties take effect. The country also restricted exports of rare earth elements critical for technology manufacturing and added 11 American businesses to its \"Unreliable Entity List.\" Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff plan particularly threatens Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing despite years of diversification efforts. The 54% effective rate on Chinese imports combines the new 34% tariff with an existing 20% charge. Countries where Apple has been expanding its supply chain, including India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, were also targeted with tariffs above Trump's global baseline rate of 10%. Analysts warn Apple faces difficult choices ahead, potentially needing to raise U.S. hardware prices by approximately 30% to offset the tariff impact or accept significant hits to its profit margins.

{"text": "If you're reexamining your monthly expenses in light of the market turmoil, personal finance influencers are ready to help. President Donald Trump's new tariff policies have sent markets downward, resulting in a wave of uncertainty for business owners and everyday consumers. So, what should you do? We asked top finance influencers to share their No. 1 pieces of advice in the current economic climate. Rather than act on impulse, the influencers said not to panic. A few of them mentioned the idea of creating a smart budget. \"Your budget is just a plan for how to pace your money for the month,\" said Nadia Vanderhall, a financial planner and LinkedIn influencer. \"It's really about knowing what's coming in, what's going out.\" Here are the key budgeting takeaways the influencers shared: Avoid getting \"caught with your pants down\" by establishing a cushion in the event of a job loss, said Mal Baska, who has 31,000 followers on Instagram account Money Talk Mal. \"Ensure you have a solid cash cushion, or emergency fund, in a high-yield savings account,\" Baska said. \"If not, budget to optimize this cushion and safety net.\" YouTuber Sebastian Fung, whose AskSebby account has 312,000 subscribers, recommends having 6 to 12 months of expenses in savings, especially if you are concerned about layoffs. \"I would look into money market funds or high-yield savings accounts \u2014 that way, you're still earning interest while maintaining liquidity,\" he said. If prices begin to go up, Vanderhall said to look at your last month's spending to see what expenses have increased and use that information to shape your budget for the next month. Vanderhall said to start with real numbers: Look at your actual income and expenses by analyzing your bank and credit card statements from the last 30 to 60 days. Break your budget down into categories such as bills, groceries, transportation, debt, savings, and \"fun\" money. There are several ways to track a budget, but it's important to use a method that matches your lifestyle, Vanderhall said. That could be writing it down, using a spreadsheet, or using an app. Tolani Eweje, who writes the Substack newsletter The Creator Success Club, said simple budgets stick. She uses this framework: If your income fluctuates month-to-month, base it on your last six months' average, she said. Once you've evaluated your budget, go a step further by trying to lower your costs. Baska said you should start soon if you are worried about price increases. \"Negotiate your auto insurance, cellphone, medical bills, salary, etc.,\" Baska said. \"Now is the time to lock in pricing before companies really get hit.\" When it comes to salary, take the time to learn your state's salary history and transparency laws, said Hannah Williams, creator of Salary Transparent Street. \"Not knowing your market rate and legal protections leaves you vulnerable to being underpaid and taken advantage of by employers looking to save on their bottom line,\" Williams said. If you're more of a spreadsheet person, you can build your own budget sheet using Google Sheets or Excel, said Bola Sokunbi, the creator of Clever Girl Finance with 356,000 followers on Instagram. \"But if you're more into apps, the best one is the one you'll actually use,\" Sokunbi said. She recommends browsing the top-reviewed budgeting apps in your phone's app store and testing a few out until you find one that fits your lifestyle. The finance influencers recommended several apps, including Lunch Money, Monarch Money, Copilot Money, Origin Financial, and tMoney. \"Setting realistic budget parameters and spending categories is key to success and sustainability,\" Baska said. Instead of evaluating your finances at the end of each month, Fung recommends doing it weekly so that you can adjust as needed. That way if you spent too much money eating out, you can plan to cook the following week, Fung said. That's especially true if prices are changing quickly, which could happen if tariffs have an impact. But if you want to cut down on your going-out budget, figure out how to still have fun. \"Find other ways to keep yourself occupied,\" Sokunbi said. \"All those subscriptions that we all pay for, it's time to use them. Use your Netflix, your Hulu, and your Apple TV subscriptions. Leverage your library app. There are so many things that you can use to occupy your time.\" Jump to", "summary": "Personal finance influencers share their No. 1 piece of advice in the current economic climate .<n>A few of them mentioned the idea of creating a smart budget .<n>\"It's really about knowing what's coming in, what'"}
{"text": "After making high-dollar donations and, in some cases, appearing at President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration, billionaire tech and finance CEOs are watching their companies' stocks plunge. Since Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement of a 10% blanket tariff on all countries, on top of additional tariffs on certain countries, the stock market has experienced heavy losses in a matter of days. Here is how much eight companies lost in share value since Trump's inauguration day as of market close on Tuesday, April 8, 2025, according to Yahoo Finance. Percentage of share decline since January 21: -23% Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and attended the ceremony. Trump took credit for Apple's plans to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years. Percentage of share decline since January 21: -26% Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon and founder of Blue Origin, praised Trump for an \"extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory\" after Trump won the election. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee, and Bezos also attended the inauguration. Percentage of share decline since January 21: -27% Google donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. In addition to attending Trump's inauguration, Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, also congratulated Trump on his election win and said, \"We are in a golden age of American innovation.\" Percentage of share decline since January 21: -17% Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended the inauguration. Percentage of share decline since January 21: -4% Uber and its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, each donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. After Trump's election win, Khosrowshahi took to social media to congratulate Trump \"on a resounding victory.\" Percentage of share decline since January 21: -27% Goldman Sachs donated an unspecified amount to Trump's inauguration fund. It also removed a section about diversity and inclusion in its annual filing earlier this year, in line with Trump's crackdown on DEI policies. David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, previously praised Trump on the Fox Business Network for being \"engaged with the business community.\" Other notable business leaders who have donated in some way to Trump \u2014 though not specifically to his inauguration \u2014 are Tesla's Elon Musk and Oracle's Larry Ellison. Percentage of share decline since January 21: -48% Tesla CEO Elon Musk donated at least $260 million to put Trump back in the White House. Musk and his PAC also spent at least $12 million on the Wisconsin Supreme Court election to support a conservative candidate, who eventually lost. Tesla's diminished share value comes after not only tariff and recession fears but also a widespread protest movement against his company and involvement in the White House DOGE office. One Telsa fan called the carmaker's decline in sales \"brutal,\" and branding experts have said it would take significant concessions from Musk to rebrand Tesla. Musk himself said that running his businesses while working closely with the White House hadn't been easy. Percentage of share decline since January 21: -28% Oracle's cofounder and chairman, Larry Ellison, was one of the few top technology executives to openly support Trump back in 2020. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his Rancho Mirage estate in California in February 2020. Ellison, Sam Altman of OpenAI, and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son are also spearheading Project Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative supported by Trump.

{"text": "District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, in a Wednesday filing, lambasted Apple and its executives for their behavior during the Epic Games antitrust case, writing that they violated a 2021 injunction in the case. Rogers, in her order, wrote that Alex Roman, Apple's vice president of finance, \"outright lied\" to the court while under oath about when Apple decided to impose a 27% commission fee on transactions facilitated through its App Store. Roman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \"Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies,\" Rogers wrote. \"They did not seek to withdraw the testimony or to have it stricken . Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this Court.\" The court referred the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California \"to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\" The ruling stems from a case brought against Apple by the video game developer Epic Games in 2020, in which Epic Games accused Apple of engaging in anticompetitive practices related to its control over the App Store and in-app payment systems. In 2021, following a trial, the court ruled that Apple's restrictions on in-app purchasing methods outside the one offered by the App Store were indeed anticompetitive. The ruling largely favored Apple, finding that the company had engaged in anticompetitive behavior in only one of 10 counts. The Court then issued an injunction forcing Apple to allow developers to inform users about external purchasing options, but Rogers says the company refused to comply with the injunction. \"Apple's response to the Injunction strains credulity,\" Rogers wrote in the Wednesday filing. \"After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction's goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream. Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up.\" An Apple spokesperson told Business Insider that the company \"strongly\" disagrees with the court's decision. \"We will comply with the court's order, and we will appeal,\" the spokesperson said.

{"text": "If Apple resolves the dispute with Epic Games, a new skin could be on its way, too by Nicole Carpenter Apple can no longer charge a fee for purchases made outside of an iOS app, Epic Games vs. Apple judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled Wednesday night. The judge had issued a permanent injunction in 2021 forbidding Apple from blocking third-party payment options \u2014 and the court found that Apple was in \u201cwillful violation\u201d of the 2021 injunction, and started to collect a 27% fee on transactions made outside of the iOS store. \u201cApple\u2019s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers wrote in a document filed Wednesday. Gonzalez Rogers is looking at potential criminal contempt proceedings for Apple\u2019s violations; she also says in the document that Apple vice president of finance \u201coutright lied under oath\u201d when asked about the 27% fees. Following the decision, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on X to announce that Epic Games will \u201creturn Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.\u201d Further, if Apple removes the third-party payment fee worldwide, Epic Games will put Fortnite back on the iOS App Store globally and \u201cdrop current and future litigation on the topic.\u201d Fortnite has been unavailable through the iOS App Store since 2020, when Apple blocked the game for Epic Games\u2019 attempt to circumvent the payment fee. The one caveat in Fortnite\u2019s return to the iOS App Store is that, like every other app, Apple needs to approve it before it\u2019s available to the public. Apple had previously blocked one of Epic Games\u2019 developer accounts, but Sweeney said Wednesday that Epic Games has others it can use. It intends to upload Fortnite for approval that way. \u201cWe just have to see what Apple does,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cApple could arbitrarily reject Epic from the App Store despite us following all of the rules. But, you know, they would have to deal with various consequences of that.\u201d When Fortnite was removed from the App Store, Epic Games added skin to the game that was a symbol of its ongoing battle: the Tart Tycoon, a shrewd businessman with an Apple for its head. Sweeney told press Wednesday that Epic Games has prepared a second skin in the anticipation of reaching a reconciliation with Apple. \u201cIf if we\u2019re able to reach resolution with Apple, then it might be possible for our players to have the ability to earn the Pine Patron outfit,\u201d Sweeney said. Epic Games declined to share more information about the Pie Patron skin. Apple doesn\u2019t seem to agree with the ruling, so it sounds like the Pie Patron may be a ways off; the company did not respond to Polygon\u2019s request for comment, but a spokesperson told The Verge that it \u201cstrongly disagree with the decision.\u201d Apple intends to comply with the order while appealing it. Effective immediately, Apple can\u2019t impose fees, restrict or block how developers place links to purchases outside of the app, and use \u201cscare screens\u201d to dissuade users from leaving the app. \u201cApple willfully chose not to comply with this Court\u2019s Injunction,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers wrote. \u201cIt did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive.

You should expect iPhone prices to go up this year, even if tariffs don't go sky high. Apple may move its assembly of US phones to India, and many of its devices are currently exempt from reciprocal tariffs on China. So, does that mean iPhone prices won't go up? Don't bet on it -- and not just because of tariffs, say experts. \"The iPhone is due for a price increase,\" said CNET managing editor Patrick Holland, who's been reviewing phones for CNET since 2016. \"The entry level iPhone is $829 and has cost that much for years. The last time it had a price  was in 2020.\" If the price of an iPhone does inch up, you may not even realize it. \" probably be buried in the promotional deals or the installment plans,\" said Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's Worldwide Device Tracker suite, which includes mobile phones, tablets and wearables. \"Yes, it might cost 50 bucks more at some stage, but we spread that over time, and it's a monthly installment plan.\" It's been less than a month since President Donald Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, launching a roller-coaster ride of raising and pausing tariffs on imports from nearly 100 countries. That included triple-digit levies for China, where Apple currently produces most of its products. Even before Trump announced the tariffs, Apple's biggest suppliers in India had shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March, according to customs records. Trump ended up exempting smartphones and some other electronics from his reciprocal tariffs, leaving in place a 20% tariff on goods shipped from China. Some politicians have questioned this exemption, and last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook asking how Apple products were excluded after Trump said there would be no tariff exemptions. On top of this, Apple reportedly may source its iPhones for the US market from India by the end of 2026 -- although perhaps not all of them. India was among those reprieved temporarily from its 26% reciprocal tariff but is still subject to a 10% tariff on all imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that he expects India to be the first to secure a tariff deal, according to the New York Post. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Regardless of where tariffs end up, you should be prepared for potential price increases on electronics. We have alternative options to help you save on them, including the iPhone. If the full cost of current tariffs were passed on to shoppers, we could see anywhere from a 26% hike on Apple products manufactured in India to a 145% increase for those made in China. But currently, tariffs on goods from India have a 10% tariff and iPhones manufactured in China are still subject to Trump's 20% \"fentanyl tariff\" for the country's supposed role in allowing fentanyl to enter the US. Here's how that could potentially affect the price of the iPhone: But there's a lot more that goes into the price of an iPhone than simply where it's assembled. Apple sources components for its products from a long list of countries, which could face higher tariffs after the pause. And a tariff on goods doesn't necessarily mean prices will go up by the same amount. If companies want to stay competitive, they could absorb some of the costs to keep their prices lower. \"It won't be as high as 1-to-1 in terms of the tariff increases,\" Reith said. \"The math isn't as clear-cut as that on the tariffs.\" It's unclear exactly when prices could go up but if companies sell out of devices produced before the tariffs, they may have to increase prices on products in tariffed shipments. However, even if Apple can't avoid tariffs entirely, it has ways to offset the impact through its services -- including its music, news and data plans -- according to supply chain expert Joe Hudicka. \"Apple will likely absorb some of the tariff costs up front to keep sticker prices stable, then pass the rest on to consumers gradually through service bundles, device longevity and ecosystem upgrades,\" he said. \"Consumers will still pay, just not all at once.\" It's also unclear exactly how much of an impact the tariffs will have on prices for all smartphones. If rising prices cause demand to plummet, experts note that Apple and other producers could reduce their prices to stay competitive. Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports plus reciprocal tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" He quickly announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs but left the baseline levies in place. Trump's long touted tariffs as a way to even the trade deficit and raise revenue to offset tax cuts, although many economists say that tariffs could lead to higher prices and may end up hurting the US economy. Stock prices plummeted after Trump's announcement as markets reacted poorly to the sweeping tariffs. Trump has taken an especially hard stance on China, which was already subject to tariffs that Trump ordered during his first term in office. He started in February, imposing 20% in tariffs, then announced a 34% tariff on goods from China earlier this month. He added an additional 50% tariff before eventually landing on the 145% tariff against China. China has responded with its own tariffs after each of Trump's announcements. The US Customs and Border Protection listed some key consumer electronics exempted from the reciprocal tariffs this month, but Trump said that those products would still be subject to a 20% fentanyl tariff. White House officials said the reprieve from additional tariffs was temporary and that those products would instead be subject to a \"semiconductor tariff.\" Tariffs, in theory, are designed to financially impact other countries because their goods are being taxed. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the product, and this upcharge is usually -- but not always -- passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. If you already planned to buy a new iPhone, gaming console, MacBook or other tech, buying it now might save you money. But if you don't need a new phone immediately, Holland recommends waiting. \"If iPhone prices rise, know that, like cars, the prices for used iPhones will likely rise, too,\" he said. \"If Apple does raise its prices, you'll likely get more for your old iPhone when you trade it in, and that should offset any increased prices.\" If you don't have the cash on hand and are considering using a credit card or buy now, pay later plan just to avoid tariffs, make sure you have the money to cover the costs before you start accruing interest. With credit cards' average interest rates currently more than 20%, the cost of financing a big purchase could quickly wipe out any savings you'd get by buying before prices go up because of tariffs. \"If you finance this expense on a credit card and can't pay it off in full in one to two months, you'll likely end up paying way more than a tariff would cost you,\" said Alaina Fingal, an accountant, founder of The Organized Money and a CNET Money Expert Review Board member. \"I would recommend that you pause on any big purchases until the economy is more stable.\" One way to save on Apple products, even if prices go up, is to buy last year's model instead of the newest release or a used one. And trading or selling a used one can help offset the cost even more. \"Apple has leaned into that with its Certified Refurbished program, much like the auto industry's used car model,\" Hudicka said. \"This program helps extend the lifespan of devices, keeping customers in the Apple ecosystem longer while distributing the cost impact over time.\" Tiffany Connors Editor Tiffany Wendeln Connors is a senior editor for CNET Money with a focus on credit cards.

{"text": "The latest twist in the long-running legal fight between Apple and Epic Games has delivered a major blow to the company\u2019s App Store operations. In a ruling issued Tuesday, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple in willful violation of a 2021 injunction designed to stop the company\u2019s anticompetitive App Store practices. According to the 80-page order, Apple \u201cthwarted the injunction\u2019s goals\u201d by imposing new fees and obstacles that continued to stifle competition, despite clear instructions from the court. The judge didn\u2019t just sanction Apple \u2014 she referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for possible criminal contempt proceedings. Epic Games, which first sued Apple in 2020 over App Store restrictions and commissions, described Apple\u2019s recent behavior as a blatant attempt to rewrite the rules. The court agreed, highlighting internal Apple documents and testimony that revealed a coordinated effort to preserve billions in App Store revenue under the guise of compliance. Apple\u2019s VP of Finance, Alex Roman, was found to have lied under oath, according to the document. Internal documents contradicted public testimony and showed Apple knowingly chose anticompetitive options. Apple Fellow Phil Schiller advocated for compliance with the court\u2019s order, per the ruling, but CEO Tim Cook sided with the finance team to preserve revenue, ignoring the court\u2019s directive. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly.\u201d \u2014 Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, April 30, 2025 ruling in Epic Games v. Apple The court has now barred Apple from charging its 27% commission on external purchases and ordered it to immediately stop interfering with developers\u2019 ability to communicate alternative payment options to users. The judge specifically called out Apple\u2019s use of full-page \u201cscare screens\u201d designed to deter users from leaving the App Store payment flow, its requirement that developers use static, non-dynamic URLs when linking to alternative payment methods, and its policy of still claiming a commission on web purchases made outside the App Store. Interested to see what comes of lying under oath. It could be a bad days ahead for some execs if that holds up. These design choices, the court found, were engineered to introduce friction and suppress user conversion. By requiring static URLs, Apple limited developers\u2019 ability to pass contextual data or personalize checkout flows \u2014 a common practice in modern e-commerce. Meanwhile, the scare screens served to discourage users from completing external transactions, undermining the intent of the injunction, which was to enable meaningful competition outside Apple\u2019s in-app payment system. The judge described Apple\u2019s behavior as a blatant attempt to sidestep the court\u2019s authority, writing that the company\u2019s response \u201cstrains credulity\u201d and amounted to a cover-up Apple seemingly believed the court wouldn\u2019t uncover. Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney claimed victory on social media following the ruling: NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax.Apple\u2019s 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act.

{"text": "Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap. Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap. by Tina Nguyen and Kylie Robison AI companies can\u2019t figure out if the Trump tariffs are about to decimate them \u2013 and the fact that no one has a clear answer is sending them, and the tech industry overall, into a confusion spiral. The markets are in disarray. Nvidia is down 7.59%, TSMC is down 7.22%. In San Francisco, sources tell us that this isn\u2019t a big deal. But in DC, people are panicking. The core question is whether GPUs \u2013 the graphics processing units that are crucial to AI computing and other industries \u2013 are exempted from Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, and the answer is startlingly ambiguous. Inside AI labs, researchers expect that their industry will be granted a tariff exemption. \u201cI fully expect this to be a situation where Trump again gives companies he views as important/on his side/whatever a hall pass,\u201d similar to what the President did with Apple during his first term, one source inside a major AI lab told The Verge. In Washington, however, nobody seems sure what the current state of play is. The Trump administration spelled out an exception for the semiconductor chips at the heart of a GPU, but for now, complete electronic products that contain chips will apparently be subject to tariffs. And companies that need GPUs for machine learning, deep learning, real-time processing, and much more require not just the chip, but the entire machine built around it. \u201cMost AI GPUs are, I believe, imported not as chips but as servers, largely from Taiwan,\u201d Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology, told The Verge in an email. \u201cSo these would presumably face the general Taiwan tariff rate\u201d of 32%, currently scheduled to hit on April 9th. Ordinarily, government agencies might be able to explain what\u2019s happening. But when asked for clarity, a public affairs official at NIST, the agency at the Commerce Department overseeing the CHIPS Act \u2013 a $50 billion investment in building chip manufacturing plants on American soil \u2013 directed The Verge to the White House. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did the U.S. Trade Representative, the agency responsible for creating and executing the President\u2019s tariff strategy. While the SF crowd is bullish on getting exemptions, tech lobbyists in Washington are closer to the chaos that is the second Trump administration, and are far too familiar with the president\u2019s mercurial whims and vindictive nature, particularly against the tech industry. The fact that the tariffs are so vague and seem haphazardly thrown together \u2013 so haphazard, in fact, that there\u2019s a legitimate argument that they were generated by AI \u2013 is only adding to their worries. \u201cEveryone\u2019s asking for clarity\u201d from the administration, one lobbyist at a major tech company told The Verge. \u201cSo far, folks are saying that they think we\u2019re okay, but not sure yet.\u201d That\u2019s not exactly a ringing vote of confidence for GPU tariff exemptions. The GPU confusion is rippling beyond the AI industry, hitting the Big Tech companies that stock thousands of these devices in datacenters across the country. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all rely on access to GPUs to prop up their multi-billion dollar cloud architectures. Clearly, the market isn\u2019t confident that their bottom line will weather these tariffs: The so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, which includes the three companies above, have lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since the tariffs were announced.  The AI industry has reason to think Trump might favor it in particular. Just a few months ago, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and other tech CEOs stood in the White House alongside the president to announce Stargate, a $500 billion datacenter infrastructure project devoted to fulfilling Altman\u2019s demands for \u201cmore compute.\u201d The current unclear state of GPUs coupled with the unpredictability of Trump\u2019s tariffs in general, however, could shake their confidence \u2014 or at least mean they must renew attempts to curry Trump\u2019s favor. \u201cIf the tariffs are unchanged, we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.\u201d GPU juggernaut Nvidia has apparently begun moving manufacturing to the US, which it hopes will help insulate it from the tariffs. Reuters reported last December, for instance, that it was finalizing plans to produce its Blackwell AI GPU chip at TSMC\u2019s Arizona plant, which aims to start fabricating chips this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang alluded to this partnership in a recent investor Q&A: \u201cWe\u2019re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around. Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we\u2019re going to have manufacturing onshore.\u201d The same can\u2019t be said for compute-hungry AI labs, hyperscale cloud providers, or even average PC builders \u2014 all of whom might end up paying substantially more for GPUs. \u201cNone of this is impossible, but trying to produce every segment of electronics supply chains domestically will produce a staggering increase in cost, especially in the short-term, given that some of the capabilities simply don\u2019t exist domestically,\u201d Miller said. That doesn\u2019t even take into account the tariffs on the raw materials needed to build these machines and plants, or any retaliatory measures: on Friday, for instance, China announced a new set of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for electronics manufacturing. The U.S. currently imports 90 percent of its rare earth minerals from China. \u201cIf the tariffs are unchanged,\u201d Miller added, \u201cwe should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.\u201d But ultimately, fealty to Trump might be more crucial than an appeal to reason. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged allegiance to the new administration, which is important for Anthropic, since it sources some of its compute through Amazon. These deals are fragile, though. A single critical story in Bezos\u2019 paper The Washington Post could lose Amazon  a tariff exemption, for instance. Anthropic also sources some of its compute through Google; along with Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai joined the gaggle of tech billionaires behind Trump at his inauguration. And there are other factors that could indirectly cause problems for these companies, of course \u2014 like the US being pushed into a recession that devastates the tech economy. \u201cThe second order effects of the tariffs could still be bad,\u201d the AI lab source added. The market tumbles seemed to have mobilized tech leaders. A group of tech CEOs and finance leaders are on their way to Trump\u2019s private resort, Mar-a-Lago, according to journalist Kara Swisher. The goal seems to be to find some sense in these tariffs \u2014 and perhaps some exemptions.

Much or even most of Nvidia's staggering success can be attributed to the cutting-edge GPUs  it makes, as these chips are high demand thanks to the AI boom. But Kress has also played a key role in the success of the company, and has become one of Nvidia's top power players, helping to guide the chipmaker to financial success that founders Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky surely never dreamt of as they agreed to found Nvidia back in 1993. Colette Kress holds a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Arizona, and an MBA from Southern Methodist University, per an Nvidia bio. Her education positioned her well to take on key positions at major companies. One of these was none other than software juggernaut Microsoft, where Kress worked for 13 years, including multiple years spent as the chief financial officer of the Server and Tools division. Kress has also worked at Cisco and Texas Instruments. Kress usually runs Nvidia's earnings calls each quarter, and has had mostly stellar earnings to report as AI's boom saw the company's chips in high demand. During Nvidia's February 2025 earnings call, for instance, the company reported $39.33 billion in revenue, well over estimates. Kress said during the call that demand for Nvidia's Blackwell GPU \"exceeded\" expectations, though Kress also warned that the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs remained a \"bit of an unknown.\" In the calendar year 2024, Nvidia's market cap  surpassed $2 trillion and then $3 trillion, an almost unheard-of ascent that landed Nvidia among the largest companies in the world in terms of value. Only Apple generates more revenue than Nvidia, with Microsoft trailing close behind, it also being a $3 trillion-plus company. While Kress' net worth is unknown, we do know Kress's compensation was around $13.3 million in 2023. Based on the rising fortunes of the company, one can assume that figure has dramatically increased since then. In fact, publicly available data shows that Nvidia employees in general saw a 17% increase in pay in the 2024 fiscal year, a much greater pay hike than most corporate workers can ever expect.

{"text": "When the US Supreme Court upheld the court ruling in the Apple vs Epic Games case, I said that the iPhone maker\u2019s response was clearly made in bad faith, and was effectively giving the middle finger to the judge in the case. The judge has now officially confirmed this view. She has not only directly called out Apple for ignoring her ruling, but said that a senior Apple exec lied under oath, and referred the matter for prosecution \u2026 I\u2019m not a fan of using bold text for emphasis, but I really have to on this occasion to emphasise just how utterly insane and incredible this is: The judge declared that Apple\u2019s VP of Finance Alex Roman lied under oath in a court of law. Apple knew this and did not comply with its legal obligation to correct the record. The matter has now been referred to the US Attorney for criminal investigation. Roman could literally be sent to jail for this, with Apple also subject to criminal sanctions. Epic Games flouted Apple\u2019s App Store rules by introducing its own in-app payment system, bypassing Apple\u2019s 30% commission. That was a blatant breach of Apple\u2019s rules, and the company threw its games out of the App Store. So far, no big deal, a simple civil dispute. The two companies went to court, and Apple mostly won. That also needs to be emphasised here, because the company could have taken the win \u2013 the finding that the App Store is not a monopoly \u2013 and gone home happy. The only area where Apple lost is that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Epic  is allowed to make in-app sales without the iPhone maker taking a cut. Most developers weren\u2019t going to bother, so the financial loss to Apple would have been pretty small. But Apple chose to flout the entire intent of the judge\u2019s ruling, and announced that it would continue to demand commission even on sales made outside the App Store. That was clearly a ridiculous response. Epic went back to court to accuse Apple of acting in bad-faith, and the judge strongly implied she agreed, and that Apple was lying about its motivation. She demanded that the iPhone maker hand over all its internal documents relating to the decision. When Apple claimed it had not been able to comply by the deadline, a second judge said he too thought the company was lying. That\u2019s two separate judges saying that one of the biggest companies in the world is probably lying. Rogers, the judge in the original case, wanted time to study Apple\u2019s documents to find out whether or not the company lied. She\u2019s now returned with an 80-page order which finds that: Specifically, she said Apple\u2019s finance VP Alex Roman told multiple lies under oath. Apple employees attempted to mislead the Court by testifying that the decision to impose a commission was grounded in AG\u2019s report. The testimony of Mr. Roman, Vice President of Finance, was replete with misdirection and outright lies. He even went so far as to testify that Apple did not look at comparables to estimate the costs of alternative payment solutions that developers would need to procure to facilitate linked-out purchases. The Court finds that Apple did consider the external costs developers faced when utilizing alternative payment solutions for linked out transactions, which conveniently exceeded the 3% discount Apple ultimately decided to provide by a safe margin. Apple did not rely on a substantiated bottoms-up analysis during its months-long assessment of whether to impose a commission, seemingly justifying its decision after the fact with the AG\u2019s report. Mr. Roman did not stop there, however. He also testified that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it would impose on linked-out purchases  Another lie under oath: contemporaneous business documents reveal that on the contrary, the main components of Apple\u2019s plan, including the 27% commission, were determined in July 2023. Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies. They did not seek to withdraw the testimony or to have it stricken . Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this Court. So now both a senior Apple exec and the company face a criminal investigation. This is, as I said earlier, utterly insane \u2013 massively more so when you consider this was one of the richest companies in the world lying in a vain attempt to prevent a rather trivial loss of income. I said at the time: Sure, what Epic Games did was dumb. It baited Apple, Apple responded, and Epic Games got hurt. FAFO. But Apple is making the exact same mistake here. It\u2019s baiting lawmakers, lawmakers will respond, and Apple will get hurt. It was obvious to me that Apple was making a dumb decision, but I had no idea then just how dumb! The judge herself cited the oft-quoted adage that it\u2019s always the cover-up that gets you. Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court\u2019s Injunction  That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the cover-up made it worse. It\u2019s the cover-up that has turned this from a civil matter into a criminal one. A good article and argument, and I agree that a Apple should simply comply and act contrite to protect their brand image, but we should note that Apple has already announced their intention to appeal. Given all of the lawyers and accountants that Apple can afford, we must assume that Apple has done so because they've run the projections and believe that complying with this ruling would cost them more than continuing to fight it would. Why would they do that? Why take the risk? I suspect it's because Tim Cook really doesn't want investors to realize just how much their \"Services\" revenue is legally-dubious rent-seeking. Keep in mind that Apple reports quarterly \"Services\" revenue, but doesn't break those numbers out by individual services. We don't know how much of that number is Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple News+, iCloud+, App Store, etc. We can reasonably expect that, if the App Store share were small, Apple would have said so in court and to investors. It would serve to show the court \"Look, we're not skimming that much money from the market, let us continue\" and it would show investors \"We have diversified services revenue, that's healthy.\" But they don't do that. Why? The only reasonable explanation is that the App Store share must be massive, and Apple knows how bad it would look if they acknowledged how much of their \"pivot to services\" revenue growth the last few years has been funded by rent-seeking practices. I don't think Cook will be remembered fondly. We outlined yesterday the three options now open to Apple: The only sane one of the three is the first. Anything else simply drags this out even further, with even further embarrassment to the company. We can guarantee that Apple will be asked about this in today\u2019s earnings call. This is the perfect opportunity for the company to admit its mistakes, apologize for them, announce that it will be fully complying with the judge\u2019s ruling, and try to finally put this mess behind them. That won\u2019t necessarily end things completely \u2013 criminal prosecutions may yet follow \u2013 but it\u2019s the best shot the company has. I just wish I believed the company will do it.

{"text": "Warren Buffett kept quiet when stocks tumbled. On Saturday, the famed investor will break his silence with nearly five hours of questions at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. The $1 trillion conglomerate, which Buffett still heads at 94, owns many businesses, including auto insurer Geico and the BNSF Railway, and holds billion-dollar stakes in public companies such as Apple and Coca-Cola. If it's affecting the US economy, it's affecting Berkshire. That, combined with Buffett's decades of investing experience, will have tens of thousands of followers hanging off his every word during the event in his hometown of Omaha. More than a dozen of Buffett's close followers told Business Insider the burning questions they want him to answer, from tariff impacts and Berkshire's cash pile to his retirement plans and Apple disposals. Tariffs have reignited investors' fears of inflation and recession, sparking an exodus from US stocks, Treasurys, and the dollar in recent weeks. \"I'd like to hear how the tariffs are affecting Berkshire's businesses now, and how they may affect the businesses in the future,\" Steven Check, the CEO of Check Capital Management, told BI. He also wanted to hear Buffett's views on tariffs from a global perspective. Adam Mead, the author of \" The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway \" and a money manager, told BI that Trump's tariffs \"might change the calculus\" for Berkshire's solar projects, adding they likely source many of their panels and equipment from overseas. Adam Schwartz, the founder and chief investor of Black Bear Value Partners, told BI he hoped Buffett would address tariffs and advise investors on protecting their portfolios. Schwartz said, \"Does he view the tariff policy as a structural change in the environment, and how do you handicap the downside?\" John Longo \u2014 a finance professor, investment chief, and the author of \"Buffett's Tips: A Guide to Financial Literacy and Life\" \u2014 told BI he hoped Buffett would say whether he still thinks the US trade deficit is an urgent problem as he argued in a Fortune article in 2003. Buffett nearly doubled Berkshire's pile of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid assets to a record $334 billion last year, partly by selling a net $134 billion of stocks and halting share buybacks in the second half. His followers want to know what he plans to do with that war chest, which exceeds Coca-Cola's entire market value. He could use the dry powder to make a blockbuster acquisition, scoop up stocks, reinstate share purchases, or even pay a dividend. \"Why is he amassing this huge cash position, and where would the stock market need to fall for him to write 'Buy American. I Am.' like he did in the fall of 2008?\" asked Bill Smead, the founder and chief investor of Smead Capital Management. Smead was referring to Buffett's famous New York Times op-ed at the height of the financial crisis, in which he urged others to join him in making long-term bets on American businesses. Alex Morris, the author of \"Buffett and Munger Unscripted\" and the founder of investment research service TSOH, told BI he was \"curious\" to hear whether Buffett still believes Berkshire should have a minimum of $30 billion in cash reserves, and what \"the largest deal they could do today\" would be. Buffett's acolytes are also waiting impatiently to learn whether the legendary bargain hunter capitalized on the recent stock plunge. \"Has Berkshire been investing its cash after the sharp market decline in April?\" asked David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger. Berkshire sold 67% of its biggest stock position, Apple, in the first nine months of 2024. But it left the remaining 300 million shares intact in the fourth quarter, even though the iPhone maker's stock traded higher than it did earlier in the year. That raises a roughly \"$60 billion question of why not sell the whole position?\" Mead told BI. \"It's a bit perplexing.\" Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management, also queried the remaining Apple stake. The stock is down around 12.5% year-to-date. \"He's Warren Buffett, he obviously has a thoughtful rationale, and I'd love to hear it,\" Pollock told BI. Buffett often sheds light on Berkshire's myriad subsidiaries during his annual Q&A. \"I always enjoy the color provided on the key businesses,\" Paul Lountzis, the president of Lountzis Asset Management, told BI. He reeled off Geico, the overall insurance division, the BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Berkshire's manufacturing and retailing segments. Several followers said they hoped Buffett would compare Geico, the revitalized auto insurer, to its archrival Progressive on profitability, market share, and underwriting expenses. Mead said he wanted to know why Berkshire valued energy giant BHE below $50 billion in a deal last year to buy a minority interest from his late friend Walter Scott's estate, despite valuing it closer to $90 billion when Berkshire purchased non-insurance chief Greg Abel's stake in 2022. \"Is BHE really worth that much less today compared to then, or was that a quirk in the purchase agreement with the Scott estate?\" Mead asked. At 94, Buffett has been detailing his estate planning and championing his planned successor, Abel, in his recent letters to shareholders. Kass told BI he'd like to know whether Buffett plans to resign as CEO in the near future. Others said they were hungry for insights into how Abel would run the company. Lawrence Cunningham, the author of numerous books about Berkshire and the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center on Corporate Governance, told BI he wanted to hear from Abel, \"particularly his vision for Berkshire's future and how he plans to uphold the company's core values and strategic direction.\" Luke Rahbari, the CEO of Equity Armor Investments, told BI he was eager for Abel to elaborate on how he'll \"approach capital allocation, including stock picking and acquisitions, and how might his leadership style differ from Buffett's?\" Morris referred to how Buffett urged the US government in his latest shareholder letter to use Berkshire's record tax payment to help the less fortunate. \"Relative to current US policies, what does Warren believe would be the most effective additional way to take care of the people who got the short straws?\" he asked. Brett Gardner, an analyst and the author of the recently released \"Buffett's Early Investments,\" told BI he's crossing his fingers that the Berkshire chief will be asked about some of his findings: such as whether an early bet, Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, was an \"inspiration for Berkshire,\" and details on how Buffett analyzed the corporate governance risks attached to buying 5% of Disney in 1966. \"Selfishly, I am hoping he gets some questions on my book!\" Gardner added. Brian Gongol, a Buffett superfan who's been a shareholder since 2007, told BI his question was inspired by Buffett's oft-repeated advice: \"Invest in yourself.\" \"I'd like to know what he thinks was Berkshire's best reinvestment in itself, whether it took place this past year or simply bore fruit in the last year,\" he said.

{"text": "By John Gruber Listen Later \u2014 Turn articles into podcasts and listen anytime, anywhere. I\u2019m linking here to Techmeme\u2019s roundup of news coverage and commentary, but I highly recommend you start by reading Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s 80-page decision. It is excoriating. I\u2019ve read few legal decisions quite like it. But it\u2019s also incredibly cogent and plainly written. From the start: To summarize: One, after trial, the Court found that Apple\u2019s 30 percent commission \u201callowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins\u201d and was not tied to the value of its intellectual property, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple\u2019s response: charge a 27 percent commission  on off-app purchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the commission for a period of seven days after the consumer linked-out of the app. Apple\u2019s goal: maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. Two, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple\u2019s response: impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page \u201cscare\u201d screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple\u2019s goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court\u2019s Injunction. There\u2019s quite a bit of fury in those italics. Rule one when you\u2019re in court, any court, is \u201cDon\u2019t piss off the judge.\u201d Apple has absolutely infuriated Gonzales Rogers through actions that all of us saw as outrageous. In stark contrast to Apple\u2019s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein, more than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a violation. The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers\u2019 ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases. You know a judge is pissed when she busts out the bold italics. Later, on : Prior to the June 20 meeting, there were individuals within Apple who were advocating for a commission, and others advocating for no commission. Those advocating for a commission included Mr. Maestri and Mr. Roman. Mr. Schiller disagreed. In an email, Mr. Schiller relayed that, with respect to the proposal for \u201ca 27% commission for 24 hours,\u201d \u201cI have already explained my many issues with the commission concept,\u201d and that \u201cclearly I am not on team commission/fee.\u201d Mr. Schiller testified that, at the time, he \u201chad a question of whether we would be able to charge a commission\u201d under the Injunction, a concern which he communicated. Schiller comes across as Apple\u2019s sole voice of reason, fairness, and dare I say honesty in this entire ruling. The only people in the world who seemed to think Apple could or should comply with the 2021 injunction  by charging a commission \u2014 any commission, let alone a 27 percent commission \u2014 on those web transactions were Apple\u2019s finance team members, led by Luca Maestri and Alex Roman, and Tim Cook. Unlike Mr. Maestri and Mr. Roman, Mr. Schiller sat through the entire underlying trial and actually read the entire 180-page decision. That Messrs. Maestri and Roman did neither, does not shield Apple of its knowledge  of the Court\u2019s findings. I mean Jesus H. Christ, that\u2019s scathing. It\u2019s worth pointing out that Luca Maestri is no longer Apple\u2019s CFO.  Back in August, Apple announced that Maestri was, effectively, retiring as CFO \u201cas part of a planned succession\u201d. Apple\u2019s statement didn\u2019t use the word retiring, but rather the word transitioning. With this ruling and Maestri\u2019s central role in Apple\u2019s decision to forge ahead with a compliance plan where they \u201callowed\u201d steering to the web by charging the same effective commissions on web transactions as they do for in-app transactions, I now have to wonder whether Maestri retired or \u201cretired\u201d. \u201cCook chose poorly\u201d  is not the sort of sentence from a judge that keeps CFOs in their jobs. As for Alex Roman, I think he\u2019s in some serious trouble. Like doing-time-in-the-clink trouble: Despite its own considerable evaluation, during the first May 2024 hearing, Apple employees attempted to mislead the Court by testifying that the decision to impose a commission was grounded in AG\u2019s report. The testimony of Mr. Roman, Vice President of Finance, was replete with misdirection and outright lies. He even went so far as to testify that Apple did not look at comparables to estimate the costs of alternative payment solutions that developers would need to procure to facilitate linked-out purchases. The Court finds that Apple did consider the external costs developers faced when utilizing alternative payment solutions for linked out transactions, which conveniently exceeded the 3% discount Apple ultimately decided to provide by a safe margin. Apple did not rely on a substantiated bottoms-up analysis during its months-long assessment of whether to impose a commission, seemingly justifying its decision after the fact with the AG\u2019s report. Mr. Roman did not stop there, however. He also testified that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it would impose on linked-out purchases: Q. And I take it that Apple decided to impose a 27 percent fee on linked purchases prior to January 16, 2024, correct? A. The decision was made that day. Q. It\u2019s your testimony that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what \u2014 what fee it\u2019s going to impose on linked purchases? A. That is correct. Another lie under oath: contemporaneous business documents reveal that on the contrary, the main components of Apple\u2019s plan, including the 27% commission, were determined in July 2023. Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies. They did not seek to withdraw the testimony or to have it stricken . Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this Court. There\u2019s so much more. The whole ruling is compelling \u2014 and damning \u2014 reading. Keep in mind this whole thing stems from an injunction from a lawsuit filed by Epic Games that Apple largely won. The result of that lawsuit was basically, \u201cOK, Apple wins, Epic loses, but this whole thing where apps in the App Store aren\u2019t allowed to inform users of offers available outside the App Store, or send them to such offers on the web  via easily tappable links, is bullshit and needs to stop. If the App Store is not anticompetitive it should be able to compete with links to the web and offers from outside the App Store.\u201d Are the results of this disastrous for Apple\u2019s App Store business? I don\u2019t think so at all. Gonzales Rogers is demanding that Apple ... do what Phil Schiller recommended they do all along, which is to compete fair and square with purchases available on the web. She\u2019s not demanding they do what, say, Tim Sweeney wanted them to do. She\u2019s basically saying Phil Schiller was right. Read her entire ruling and it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone disagreeing with that. But are the results of this disastrous for Apple\u2019s reputation and credibility? It sure seems like it. But it would be worse \u2014 much worse \u2014 for Apple\u2019s reputation if Phil Schiller weren\u2019t still there. Without him, this ruling makes it sound like they\u2019d be lost, both ethically and legally. I\u2019ll give the final words to Gonzales Rogers\u2019s own closing: Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court\u2019s Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the cover-up made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple.

{"text": "Five years ago, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for its in-app purchase policies. Since then, things mostly haven\u2019t worked out in Epic\u2019s favor. But this week, a federal judge rebuked Apple for \u201cwillfully violating\u201d an earlier injunction. Coupled with claims that a top Apple executive lied under oath and a referral for criminal contempt, Epic may have secured a major victory for developers. Epic\u2019s lawsuit stems from its intentionally violating App Store policies by offering mobile users a direct payment option for in-game purchases. This circumvented Apple\u2019s 30% commission on in-App Store purchases. In response, Apple  removed Fortnite from mobile stores. And thus, Epic formally launched Project Liberty to dismantle Apple\u2019s monopoly on mobile gaming. But in 2021, United States District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Roger largely ruled in Apple\u2019s favor and even ordered Epic to pay Apple lost revenue. However, she did rule that Apple needed to let developers use and notify people in-app of alternative payment options. That is at the center of Gonzalez Rogers\u2019 Wednesday ruling coming down on Apple\u2019s \u201cwillful violation\u201d of court orders. According to Gonzalez Rogers, Apple \u201ccontinued its anticompetitive conduct\u201d after it couldn\u2019t get the Supreme Court to strike down her injunction. Chief amongst complaints is that Apple imposed a new 27% fee on developers for purchases outside of the App Store. That\u2019s alongside its pre-existing 30% commission for in-App Store purchases. \u201cApple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this court\u2019s injunction,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers wrote. She also stated that Apple \u201cknew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.\u201d  Online, Epic\u2019s Chief Executive Tim Sweeney celebrated the win, tweeting, \u201cApple\u2019s 15030% junk fees are now just as dead here in  as they are in Europe\u2026Unlawful here, unlawful there.\u201d NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple\u2019s 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there. 4 years 4 months 17 days.  pic.twitter.com/3kSYnt5pcI \u2014 Tim Sweeney  April 30, 2025 In addition to its new commission, Apple tried to dissuade customers from using alternative payment methods at all. Per the New York Times, CEO Tim Cook requested that customers receive a \u201cscare\u201d screen saying \u201cApple\u2019s privacy and security standards do not apply to purchases made on the web.\u201d While executive Phillip Schiller tried to get Apple to comply with the court, Tim Cook ignored his advice. Gonzalez Rogers wrote, \u201cCook chose poorly.\u201d Gonzalez Rogers also stated that Apple\u2019s vice president of finance, Alex Roman, \u201coutright lied\u201d at a May 2024 hearing. During it, Apple tried to \u201cmislead the Court\u201d regarding its decision to introduce a new commission. When asked, Roman testified that Apple hadn\u2019t decided the fee until January 16, 2024, but documents show that it was decided in July 2023. \u201cNeither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now, obvious lies,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers wrote. \u201cThey did not seek to withdraw the testimony or have it stricken.\u201d She has referred the matter to U.S. District Attorneys to determine if both Roman and Apple should face criminal proceedings. On X, Sweeney extended Apple a peace proposal. He wrote, \u201cIf Apple extends the court\u2019s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we\u2019ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.\u201d Apple did not respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment. It has not issued an official statement regarding the next steps. However, Gonzalez made it clear that this is \u201cnot a negotiation.\u201d \u201cThere are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTime is of the essence.

Apple\u2019s enterprise business is doing incredible, but not because of subscriptions or recurring revenue. The bulk of Apple\u2019s enterprise comes from hardware sales, with Macs, iPhones, and iPads that are powering businesses worldwide. While Apple does offer services like AppleCare and Apple Business Essentials, their impact on recurring revenue is a rounding error. At Apple\u2019s scale, it needs massive revenue to drive growth. If Apple wants to drive revenue growth in the enterprise, something has to change. Upgrade your doors with Apple Home Key and the Aqara U50. About Apple @ Work: Bradley Chambers managed an enterprise IT network from 2009 to 2021. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise grade Wi-Fi, 1000s of Macs, and 1000s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments. Apple already has the iPhone Upgrade Program and Apple Business Essentials, but it hasn\u2019t gone all-in on making a true subscription in the enterprise. Businesses buy or finance Apple devices outright , but there is no actual subscription hardware model. Imagine an Apple One for Business, where companies pay a monthly fee per user for a bundled package\u2014Mac, AppleCare, and managed services, all rolled into one recurring cost. It\u2019s a model that works for Dell with DaaS , so why not Apple? If Apple wants to drive real ARR growth in the enterprise, it needs to solve a problem IT actually has. Right now, IT teams manage Apple devices using third-party tools kuje Mosyle, Jamf, Addigy, Fleet, JumpCloud, Kandji, Microsoft Intune, and others\u2014because Apple\u2019s own device management tools aren\u2019t designed for large enterprises. Abode is the best home security system and includes compatibility with HomeKit. I don\u2019t think Apple has to compete with its own partners here, but I think it\u2019s worth taking a step back and asking: What problems do IT and security teams have today that Apple can solve? Is it something with compliance? Is it a full-feature endpoint detection and response tool? IT teams aren\u2019t looking to buy things but to solve problems. This is where Apple could start. If Apple is serious about growing ARR in the enterprise, the fastest way is through acquisition. One area where Apple is noticeably absent that I see as a growing revenue segment is identity and access management. Microsoft has Azure AD. Google has its own Workspace identity solutions. Okta is considered to be the backbone of many modern enterprises. Apple? Nothing that scales for enterprise IT. A logical move would be acquiring a company in the identity management space to create a streamlined, Apple-native authentication and security platform for businesses. With macOS and iOS already leading in enterprise security, adding a Zero Trust identity layer would strengthen Apple\u2019s position while also driving consistent subscription revenue. Apple has historically been hesitant to make big SaaS acquisitions, but if it wants a real growth path in enterprise IT revenue , a move into IAM would make sense to me. Another option might be someone in the password ecosystem like 1Password as well. If Apple wants to grow its enterprise footprint and show investors it has more revenue growth coming in the enterprise, it needs to rethink its approach\u2014whether through hardware-as-a-service, SaaS tools for IT, or a strategic acquisition in identity management.

The Fortnite battle continues to roll on for Apple - Image Credit: Epic Games Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has ruled that an Apple executive willfully lied to the court and attorneys did not correct those lies about Apple's 27% commission fee in the company's high-profile legal fight against Epic Games. Apple has taken a battering in the continuing legal battle with Epic Games over App Store rules. While Apple was found to have violated a 2021 injunction to remove anti-steering barriers, one of its executives has also been called out for lying under oath. During the trial, Apple VP of Finance Alex Roman \"outright lied\" to the court, the filing from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers declared on Wednesday, reports CNBC. Rogers wrote that Roman had lied to maintain the belief that evidence of internal discussions about a 27% commission fee on some purchases linked to the App Store was real, when it was not. Outright liedThe original 2021 ruling included an injunction against Apple, forcing it to change its anti-steering rules for the App Store, and allow for purchases to be made externally to Apple's systems. However, in 2024, Apple introduced policies to collect a 27% commission fee from those payments, in lieu of getting the usual 30% for handling in-app payments directly. Rogers writes that it was expected for such off-app payments would be free of the Apple commission. Instead, the judge explains that nearly every decision Apple made on the policies was, in the court's view, anti-competitive. The judge also warned that Apple's handling was deceptive to the court, and forced the executive to lie. Apple had presented evidence of internal discussions that were \"tailor-made for litigation,\" instead of what actually happened. \"In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anti-competitive option,\" wrote Rogers. In order to \"hide the truth\" from the court, Roman \"outright lied under oath.\" Hidden meetingThis wasn't the only deceptive practice by Apple, Rogers continued. Apple is accused by the judge of withholding documentation relating to a June 2023 meeting about the 2021 court order, involving CEO Tim Cook. The meeting's existence meeting was apparently hidden from the court by Apple until 2025. Rogers adds that Apple abused privilege to avoid sharing the documents, particularly in cases where decisions involved senior executives. In this case, the talks involved Cook and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller, with the latter preferring that Apple did not take a commission on web links. \"Cook chose poorly,\" Rogers states, as the CEO decided to ignore Schiller's advice. Potential punishmentApple didn't correct the \"now obvious\" lies, Rogers concludes, as it had instead \"adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this Court.\" It is possible that Apple and Roman could face punishment over their actions during the trial. Rogers has referred the case to U.S. attorneys for an investigation into whether to pursue criminal contempt proceedings against Roman or Apple. The accusations round out a tough court filing for Apple, which saw Rogers find Apple in violation of the 2021 injunction. Meanwhile Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has taken to social media to declare victory over Apple with a \"peace proposal.\" Apple has responded to the court that it strongly disagrees with the decision on the injunction, but it will comply with the order and appeal. It's highly probable that the headache for Tim Cook won't be over until long after Thursday evening. He has to face analysts during the Q2 results conference call late on Thursday, and the matter will almost certainly be raised by participants.

Apple is bringing in Anthropic's Claude AI to help its engineers code faster, marking a quiet but telling shift in its approach to artificial intelligence. While it'll probably look very familiar, the iPhone 17 is set to bring some performance increases and new features. Here's everything the rumor mill thinks is coming in the fall of 2025. Apple's 2025 15-inch MacBook Air equipped with the M4 chip has dropped to $1,049 as retailers compete for your business in a May price war. Both by getting an exemption, and by toiling for seven years to diversify its iPhone manufacturing efforts outside of China, the $900 million estimate of tariff impacts in the third quarter is paltry compared to what it could have been, and is for other companies. Apple's App Store has been around for 17 years, and there's a rich history and a wealth of apps to discover. Here's what you need to know, and how to get started with it. Sponsored Content Even if you're still relying on noisy gas generators, it isn't too late to start switching to solar and battery solutions from Bluetti, and save big thanks to federal tax credits and trade-in subsidy.

{"text": "Good morning. Ever considered a career in finance? The pay and perks tend to be great, but breaking into the industry can be notoriously difficult. Use this interactive guide to explore the various roads you might take to a career in banking, trading, and corporate buyouts. In today's big story, Elon Musk appears to be bored with the day-to-day at Tesla. It might be time for a Tim Cook-style CEO. What's on deck Markets: Why Deutsche Bank thinks another correction could happen. Tech: Google has a message for employees: higher performers will be rewarded. Business: Amazon is at the center of a political showdown over tariffs. But first, this is a Tim Cook moment. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Elon Musk may be bored of making cars. While Tesla was getting off to a brutal start to 2025, Musk was juggling his other commitments with \u2014 in his own words \u2014 \"great difficulty.\" Why would the CEO of the world's most valuable car company wander off to Washington when the EV battle has just entered a new, crucial stage? Because Musk likes to invent new things rather than fine-tune existing products, BI's Alistair Barr, author of the soon-to-be-launched Tech Memo newsletter, writes. Musk spent the last decade working to turn Tesla into the Western world's dominant EV company. But now, EV manufacturing is arguably a solved problem. The next stages are all about refining processes, scaling efficient production, and selling the products \u2014 that's not Musk's jam. If Musk were to relinquish control, what type of CEO would Tesla need? When Tim Cook took over Apple in 2011 after Steve Jobs died, Alistair was a tech reporter at Reuters. He recalls that investors couldn't figure out how the company might continue to thrive without Jobs' creative drive. Cook could. Since taking over, he has generated almost $3 trillion in shareholder value and made Apple the most valuable company in the world. And he did it by taking another solved problem \u2014 smartphones \u2014 and perfecting it over and over and over again. Tesla could be at a \"2011 Apple\" moment right now, Alistair writes, and a supply chain genius like Tim Cook could launch Tesla to new heights. 1. US manufacturers are very worried about a recession. In a recent Fed survey, US manufacturers said tariff and recession anxieties are making it nearly impossible to plan ahead. They're begging the Fed to lower interest rates. 2. Another correction could be on the way. Macro turmoil has led to conflicting market outlooks, Deutsche Bank says. The bank flagged three signals that could be setting the stage for a fresh correction. 3. Inside Warren Buffett's \"Woodstock for capitalists.\" Tens of thousands of investors are traveling to Omaha, Nebraska, this weekend to hear Buffett speak and to connect with fellow Berkshire shareholders. Devoted attendees told BI why they're going. 1. Google's big shakeup. The company is making changes to its compensation structure in a bid to incentivize higher performance from staff, BI exclusively reported. It'll give more employees the chance to get higher compensation, but lower performers would get smaller bonuses and equity. 2. Amazon Web Services preps staff for customer concerns. The company's cloud division is advising its frontline sales and technical staff on how to answer potential customer questions ranging from tariffs to data sovereignty, according to an internal document obtained by BI. Here's what their guidance said. 3. Snap declined to report Q2 guidance during its first-quarter earnings report. The company behind Snapchat cited uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic conditions. It joins a list of companies lowering or outright scrapping their guidance amid tariff chaos. 1. Tesla accelerates its Semi truck ambitions. The company hired more than a thousand new factory workers in Nevada to boost its Semi truck production, according to three people familiar with the matter. Until recently, Tesla had fewer than 100 factory workers assigned to the truck, two people said. 2. Amazon is at the center of a tariff-driven political fight. The retail giant says it never planned to display tariff costs on its website, despite an earlier report that said so. That didn't stop politicians on both sides of the aisle from duking it out over Trump's trade war. 3. Starbucks bets on people, not machines. The coffee giant is planning to hire more baristas and give them more hours in the next phase of its turnaround, CEO Brian Niccol said. It's also using a new algorithm to sequence orders, creating a calmer store experience. Correction: Yesterday, we featured a chart of the S&P 500 index that only showed up until April 21, 2025.

{"text": "Apple\u2019s TV division is having a standout year so far. Following the conclusion of Severance, its biggest hit ever, Apple TV+ now has three excellent new shows airing that all offer something unique. A few years back, Apple TV+ ran a fun ad featuring \u201ceveryone but Jon Hamm.\u201d Hamm actually starred in the video, lamenting that Apple TV+ has all the big celebrities and he\u2019s missing out. Later that year, Hamm actually joined The Morning Show season 3. But now, Apple TV+ has premiered its own Hamm star vehicle: Your Friends & Neighbors. In what\u2019s been described as a cross between Breaking Bad and Big Little Lies, Hamm plays a finance bro who loses everything and resorts to pawning goods stolen from his rich neighbors. Here\u2019s Apple\u2019s series summary: After being fired in disgrace, a hedge fund manager still grappling with his recent divorce, resorts to stealing from his neighbors\u2019 homes in the exceedingly affluent Westmont Village, only to discover that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined. Your Friends & Neighbors\u2019 first two episodes just premiered, and Apple has already renewed the show for a second season. If high-class character drama isn\u2019t your thing, then Apple\u2019s new hit comedy might be. The Studio stars and was co-created by Seth Rogen, and it\u2019s the kind of show that would have formerly made Jon Hamm especially jealous. That\u2019s because Apple has packed a wild number of Hollywood celebrities into the series. The Studio is all about filmmaking, so each episode lends itself to cameos from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Charlize Theron, Olivia Wilde, Zac Efron, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, and a lot more. Even Netflix\u2019s CEO gets in on the fun. Here\u2019s the series summary: Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it\u2019s the job Matt\u2019s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him. The Studio has four episodes currently available, with new weekly drops through May 21. Crime thrillers have become a standout genre on Apple TV+, and the latest such release is a strong one. Dope Thief stars Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura and is executive produced by Ridley Scott, who also directed the first episode. With a compelling, action-fueled story that doesn\u2019t get too dark thanks to well-timed comic moments, Dope Thief offers a third distinct, enticing new show on Apple TV+. Here\u2019s Apple\u2019s summary of the series: Based on Dennis Tafoya\u2019s book of the same name, the series follows longtime Philly friends and delinquents who pose as DEA agents to rob an unknown house in the countryside, only to have their small-time grift become a life-and-death enterprise, as they unwittingly reveal and unravel the biggest hidden narcotics corridor on the Eastern Seaboard. Dope Thief has six episodes available now, with weekly releases continuing through April 25. The strength of Apple\u2019s current TV+ lineup would have seemed like a fluke just a year or two ago, when the streamer\u2019s hit rate wasn\u2019t quite as high. But over the past nine months or so, Apple TV+ has truly been on a hot streak that\u2019s not yet let up. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but: who needs Severance? Apple TV+ is currently available for just *$2.99* per month with a limited-time special. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"text": "The quiet news of the last few days was the leak/announcement of a $3 billion OpenAI acquisition of Windsurf. That's not the largest private acquisition ever made \u2014 that honor goes to Google's $30 billion acquisition of Wiz a few months prior \u2014 but man, it's up there! $3B is the kind of exit startup founders dream about. Especially for a startup that's been around for 2 years, with its current branding for about 5 months. I assume most people don't know what Windsurf is, which is fair because it has so few users that when you try to Google for that information you get data about the sport. Maybe that\u2019s unfair, supposedly the company has over a million users. But I'm always a bit skeptical of numbers like that. A person who uses Windsurf every day is obviously in a different category than one that installed the tool to play around for five minutes and quickly discarded it. This slipperiness has always been one of the benefits of working in the world of privately held companies. Anecdotally I know only one person who uses Windsurf, and I only kinda sorta know that person because he's just a guy that I met at an SF house party.1 If you aren't familiar with Windsurf, you may know it by its previous name, Codeium. And if you aren't familiar with Codeium, you may know its primary competition, a company called Cursor. And if you don't know what Cursor is, a) you might know what GitHub Copilot is, and b) how did you find my blog? By the way, you should subscribe! All of these products are roughly in the same category of \"AI tools for software engineers\". They all have basically the same form factor too \u2014 they integrate AI models directly into your coding workflow. And traditionally they operate on three levels of granularity: Auto-complete. As you type the AI will suggest the rest of the line or function, which you can generally accept with a single button press. Sidebar Q&A. The code window itself will have an integrated sidebar where you can ask models to modify a few files. You'll get a diff, which you can then choose to apply or modify. Agentic flows. The term \"agent\" is wildly underspecified, but in the AI coding space the term has generally come to mean \"an AI model operates in a loop over an entire code base, often with a very vague or high level prompt as a starting point, and is equipped with tools to write, run, and otherwise analyze code and the computer system\". Different companies aim to be best in class along different verticals. Some are better at the auto complete , others at the agent flow . Some aim to be the best for non-technical people , others for large enterprises . Still, all of this \"differentiation\" ends up making a 1-2% difference in product. In fact, I can't stress enough how much the UX and core functionality of these tools is essentially identical. These all would have pejoratively been known as \"GPT wrappers\" just two years ago, because they do not actually compete on the model layer but rather allow users to choose and switch between any of the big LLM providers. To really emphasize how interchangeable these AI code assistants all are, I use an even lesser known tool called Avante, an entirely free and open source neovim plugin. It does the same things as all the other tools. I like it because I don't have to leave vim. But the similarities of these tools does not take away from how game changing they are. Once you get used to a form of AI powered coding, you cannot go back. The real issue with all of these products is that they are too easily verticalized. Anyone who wants to spin up a version of Windsurf with one slight change that targets a tiny market segment can do so fairly easily \u2014 again, I'm on Avante entirely because it supports vim. That means the addressable market for any of these companies may actually go down over time as more competitors and free alternatives enter the market, even as the number of \"programmers\" goes up.2 In point of fact, even though I love the ingenuity behind Cursor  I have openly said that their long term opportunities are slim. Even though Cursor had significant first mover advantage, they have no moat or stickiness. As with the rest of the AI market, switching cost remains extremely low, and there is simply no reason to use Cursor when you can use a free version or one with better enterprise support.3 Cursor isn't even living on its own platform \u2014 it's a fork of VSCode. I am personally convinced that their only long term exit opportunity is an acquisition by Microsoft, and even that seems less and less likely as Satya puts more resources into the already-VSCode-native Copilot as a real competitor. All of which makes the $3B price tag for Windsurf seem eye wateringly high. Compared to Cursor, Windsurf has fewer users, has been around for less time, has less brand recognition, and has diminishing prospects for future growth. It\u2019s not as tied to VSCode, which is a plus, I guess. But it all begs the question: why on earth is OpenAI paying so much? This is especially strange in the context of OpenAI's financial situation. Smart observers have caught on to Google's inherent advantages in the space, something that I first publicly called out as early as December and more fully two weeks ago. OpenAI needs to shore up both its access to compute and its access to data in order to compete. But it's once-sterling relationship with its previous patron, Microsoft, has frayed significantly. This has essentially forced the company to go to SoftBank  for additional capital.4 It's true that OpenAI managed to get $40bn committed, and it's also true that this is the largest amount of capital ever raised by a privately held company. But they're going against Google, one of the most valuable companies in the entire world, and extremely profitable to boot. That's a hell of a war chest to compete with. In that light, the decision to spend 3 out of 40 of those billions is even harder to rationalize.5 Even worse, it's not yet clear OpenAI actually has $40bn to spend \u2014 so far they've only got $10bn actually lined up, with the rest being held by SoftBank contingent on OpenAI actually becoming a for-profit company by the end of the year. It seems pretty obvious that Windsurf will not help OpenAI get more compute. Maybe Windsurf is providing OpenAI access to data? There's certainly some possibility that this is the case \u2014 though it makes me wonder just how bad OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft has gotten if they no longer have access to GitHub, which surely dwarfs any amount of code that Windsurf could provide. The other possibility is that this is entirely a long term distribution play, akin to Facebook buying WhatsApp or Instagram. People criticized those deals for being overpriced too. OpenAI may think that Windsurf will be a crown jewel in how people access GPT models. There's some sense in this \u2014 OpenAI has also announced a social media project, likely also an attempt at maintaining lines to unique data sources while providing more native ways to improve distribution and \"commoditize their complement\". But the issue that they will inevitably run into with Windsurf is that GPT just isn't the best in class for programming. Everyone who's using Windsurf is almost definitely using Claude or Gemini. Even though the \"GPT wrapper\" term was always meant as an insult, it is in practice a huge table stakes feature to be able to wrap around many different LLM providers. That flexibility is what allows a company like Windsurf to ride the machine learning wave, buoyed along by everyone else's investments. Cursor really only took off when Claude suddenly got really good at programming, after all. If Windsurf ends up being tied exclusively to GPT, many of its users may leave the platform simply because it is now a worse platform. But if there isn't any vendor lock in, we're back to square one \u2014 what is the point? Personally, I don't get it. Maybe someone smarter than I am  can help me figure it out. But for now, I'm chalking this particular check size as a symptom of the AI market being way too hot right now. The other quiet news of the last few days is the dawning realization of just how quiet it has been. The last two weeks saw the release of 3 new OpenAI models \u2014 o3, o4-mini, and GPT 4.1 \u2014 as well as the new Llama 4 model family from Meta and Grok-3 from xAI. And\u2026nothing. It's just crickets. In past months, a release calendar like this would have had headlines blazing. The hype train should be chugging at ridiculous speeds. But compared to what I'd expect, there's nothing. The reason is obvious: Google is still in the lead. Take a look at these two charts. The former is the current state of the LMSYS chatbot arena; the latter maps chatbot arena performance against price. The over under? There's no headlines because there's nothing to write about. \"OpenAI takes second place\" no one cares! It\u2019s still too early to write about \u2018general consensus\u2019 since the OpenAI models were released only a few days ago. And to their credit, those models do top many of the LLM benchmarks.6 But so far, the reception has been extremely muted, with many saying something like: Even though some of the new OpenAI models are quite powerful, they are simply too expensive and too slow for not enough extra juice. I've already written extensively about Google's Gemini 2.5 release, which quickly became the go-to model for just about everything. What I didn't originally clock was just how much Google had shored up its model offerings all over the price/performance curve. Put bluntly: at every price point, the best model is a Google model. That's not all. I mentioned rumors that Google has disallowed new publications; that is now confirmed as of earlier this month: Among the changes in the company\u2019s publication policies is a six-month embargo before \u201cstrategic\u201d papers related to generative AI are released. Researchers also often need to convince several staff members of the merits of publication, said two people with knowledge of the matter. Google has also apparently started offering extremely generous non-compete deals to researchers, preferring to keep them on payroll doing nothing than have them go to competitors and leak secrets: Google is making use of aggressive noncompete clauses and extended notice periods, contends former GoogDeepMinder Nando de Freitas in a recent post on X. In some cases, Google DeepMind\u2019s employment contracts may lock an AI developer into doing nothing for as long as a year, notes Business Insider, to prevent its AI talent from moving to competing firms. That\u2019s a long time away from working on the cutting edge in the rapidly developing world of AI. And finally, Google has continued to release and improve its TPU offerings on GCP, giving them yet another method to profit off the back of the AI boom \u2014 even if they don't win on the model, they can win by providing the underlying hardware. With almost no fanfare, we all just woke up one day to a Google-dominated AI landscape. I have been critical of Sundar in the past, but I have to hand it to him \u2014 sometimes the showmanship really is just a distraction from executing a slow but precise strategy.7 Google is clearly now on a war footing. They are relentlessly poaching employees while trying to close up their shop as much as possible. The AI industry as a whole owes more to Google than any other organization. It's unclear how many other players in that industry will survive when cut off from Google's research. It's also unclear how much this will last in the face of a continuing DOJ antitrust suit. More on that in a different article, though. One last thought. I've always been a staunch defender of capitalism and free markets, even though that's historically been an unpopular opinion in my particular social circle. Watching the LLM market, I can't help but feel extremely vindicated. Over the last 5 years, the cost per token has been driven down relentlessly even as model quality has skyrocketed. The brutal and bruising competition between the tech giants has left nothing but riches for the average consumer. There's an alternative world where all of this is priced so high that only the wealthiest businesses can justify a \"GPT license\", or where the government ends up keeping all the best AI technology for themselves. That world would objectively suck \u2014 not only would most people not be able to access the technology, there would also be significantly less interest in or ability to innovate. Just look at Google, which has finally risen like a beast from slumber to show the world what it means to innovate once more.8 9 Since we've been talking about things that didn't happen, I want to talk about one last notable absence: where the hell is Apple? Something I've said repeatedly is that the LLM market has strong winner-take-all effects, and players in the market are heavily dependent on access to scientists, compute, and data. Apple is an extraordinarily wealthy company, so they have no problem getting access to scientists. But it seems like they have had a ton of issues on both of the latter two categories. On the compute side, it seems like Apple sorta own goaled themselves? From the NYT: The A.I. stumble was set in motion in early 2023. Mr. Giannandrea, who was overseeing the effort, sought approval from the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, to buy more A.I. chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, five people with knowledge of the request said. The chips, which can perform hundreds of computations at the same time, are critical to building the neural networks of A.I. systems, like chatbots, that can answer questions or write software code. At the time, Apple\u2019s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old \u2014 far fewer than the hundreds of thousands of chips being bought at the time by A.I. leaders like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, these people said. Mr. Cook approved a plan to double the team\u2019s chip budget, but Apple\u2019s finance chief, Luca Maestri, reduced the increase to less than half that, the people said. Mr. Maestri encouraged the team to make the chips they had more efficient. The lack of GPUs meant the team developing A.I. systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its A.I. development. Well, that at least explains why they haven\u2019t been putting out any decent models. Anecdotally, Apple obviously has data centers, but they aren't a cloud provider like Google/Microsoft/Amazon, which at various points have powered DeepMind/OpenAI/Anthropic directly. So Apple is starting way behind on the whole chip thing. Maybe it makes some kind of strategic sense to try and double down on their own unique chip capacity \u2014 maybe try to do what Google has done with TPUs \u2014 but that's really being extremely generous. The more obvious answer is the simple one: Apple cheaped out, and was penny wise pound foolish. As a result, the company that dominated the mobile wave is all but absent from the AI wave.10 On the data side, Apple definitely own goaled themselves. In an environment of data hoarders and open disregard for information safety, Apple struck out as an ardent defender of user privacy. They made a brand out of it! They ran ads on it! That all made sense a few years ago, when the data itself was more questionably useful and Apple had full control of the hardware stack. Apple was able to poke fun at Google while giving Meta a pretty serious black eye over their ads policy. But now, data is almost literally fuel for deep learning models. Worse, there's basically no way to avoid leaking data through the model! People have consistently been able to get models to directly reproduce training data! Google has more or less avoided using any user data for training because they can, they have the whole Internet already indexed. Meta, xAI, OpenAI, and Anthropic all train on public user data \u2014 the former two from public posts on their social media platforms, and all four from extremely questionable flouting of copyright law. Meanwhile, Apple is stuck with the same problem Google had when they got rid of their \"Don't be evil\" motto. \"Don't be evil\" was a lot of things, and there were a lot of disagreeing interpretations about what it meant. One thing that no one disagreed about: it was hard to get rid of. Execs at Google ended up regretting the \"Don't be evil\" motto, because no matter what Google did they would get raked over the coals for doing it. \"I thought you said you wouldn't be evil\", internet commenters would snidely say. They even got sued over it! Apple is in a similar boat. Either they use the user data they have and risk serious brand damage that the rest of FAANG is sure to capitalize on, or they handicap themselves in the AI race. Which, really, is less of a race and more of an all out brawl, one in which Apple is fighting with both hands behind its back. So far, they've taken the \"handicap\" approach. They've tried to pay their way out of the data access problem by straight up buying the copyright licenses for data they want to train on, but, come on, it's just not anywhere near enough training data. The worst case scenario for Apple is they decide to use user data late. In that setting, Apple incurs the brand risk while also being miles behind everyone else. That increasingly seems like what will happen, though, because I just can't imagine Apple actually sitting the entire AI race out. So yeah. All in all, a pretty quiet few weeks for AI.

This is in contrast to the LLM market, which is not verticalized enough, and therefore is subject to really strong winner-take-all effects. Or a free version that also has better enterprise support. Anecdotally, folks at the company faithfully argue that Altman's dealings with SoftBank are indicative of his savviness and ability for the company to thrive independent of Microsoft's largesse. Personally, I think that's cope. As I said before, OpenAI spending time building data centers will slow it down, while Google quietly hums along. I should caveat that it's unlikely that OpenAI bought Windsurf in an all cash deal; likely some or maybe all of it was for stock. That doesn't necessarily make the deal any more reasonable, but funny money is a lot more flexible than real money when it comes to acquisitions. Llama 4 and Grok-3, by comparison, don\u2019t even have benchmark leaderboards to boast about. I hear Sergey is also back in the trenches, actively working on all the major Gemini releases and helping Demis set policy in the background. Unclear how much of the more aggressive Google stance is coming from elder statesmen like Sergey, Schmidt, and Page. Note that I am still quite concerned about AI safety, and from that perspective I wouldn't actually mind if we put the brakes on some or all of this. In private I've been much more of an AI doomer than I've been on this blog, but hints of that have peaked through. Maybe this is actually a critique of free market capitalism after all. This applies to labor markets too. The free wheeling labor market of California has resulted in incredible demand for AI engineers, who all command salaries that would be high for all but the most senior finance execs. As an aside, I once reported up to JG, and though I didn't know him personally I thought he did a good job running Google Research. Apple doesn\u2019t need to copycat others to sell products. Nice rundown. One additional point in the \"Google advantages\" column - Sutskever's SSI is apparently using Google TPU's, which implies they have some narrower and higher variance strategy that they're doubling down on to try to push the SOTA frontier - and of course, if they find it and demonstrate it, Google will know it exists, and could immediately throw 10x TPU's at it when they figure out what it is. The Windsurf price is obviously crazy - but it seems to me what's happening is that OpenAI is pivoting to a more traditional products focus and are counting on that to be their moat. Windsurf probably fit one of the product niches they've mapped out, and they overpaid for it in a context where there's lots of capital chasing AI wrapper companies right now. What a \"product pivot\" means overall for the overall OpenAI AGI goal is interesting to me - I never really bought any talk of slowdowns or hitting the wall that was going around a few months ago, and indeed soon after everyone was worried about that, 2.5 came out and cooked, and now o3 is out and impressive, and you know every single company has a model at least one gen advanced on what's public internally. But why worry about a product focus and customer retention now, when you have the biggest DAU's and the most name recognition by far? GPT is literally the \"kleenex\" of AI for normies. Were they spooked by 2.5? Is it a play to get more user data for further training? No posts Ready for more?", "summary": "$3 billion is the kind of exit startup founders dream about .<n>Windsurf has so few users that when you try to Google for that information you get data about the sport .<n>A person who uses Windsurf every day is obviously in a different category"}
{"text": "I\u2019ve reviewed well over 300 laptops, a handful of displays, and a smattering of accessories. Naturally, I\u2019ve gained an appreciation for great hardware design and construction, and I can pretty immediately get a sense of where a device stacks up. While several companies make great hardware, one stands apart. I\u2019m talking about Apple, and I\u2019m writing this after having reviewed the new Mac Studio, the MacBook Air 13 , the MacBook Air 15 , and the Apple Studio Display. At the end of 2023, I wrote extensively about why I made the decision to switch to Mac after decades of Windows loyalty. I made that decision based in part on the outstanding power-performance ratio that Apple Silicon brings to laptops, \u2014 along with a growing frustration with Windows. Apple\u2019s software isn\u2019t nearly perfect, especially considering the company\u2019s flawed rollout of Apple Intelligence. But since I\u2019ve made the switch \u2014 which included migrating from an Android smartphone to an iPhone and incorporating an Apple Watch \u2014 I\u2019ve been extremely happy. And reviewing so many Apple products at once just reinforced an impression that\u2019s been growing on me for a while: nobody makes hardware that\u2019s nearly as great. It might seem just a little crazy, but I\u2019m serious. To fully appreciate the sheer meticulous nature of Apple\u2019s design, you have to start with the unboxing. Since I started buying a bunch of Apple products a couple of years ago, and with receiving quite a selection of packages with my recent spate of reviews, I couldn\u2019t help but notice not only how nicely Apple packages its products, but also how consistently. Every single Apple package I\u2019ve opened, from the Apple Card credit card I signed up for to the Apple Studio Display, had exactly the same zip-pull tabs and overall easy-open design. And I mean that literally \u2014 getting to the Apple Card was basically the same as every other product. Who does that? You have to enjoy a great deal of institutional control for every single department to use exactly the same packaging. Finance, mobile, laptops, desktops, monitors, accessories \u2014 opening one product is exactly like opening another. That means that even before you pull a product out of the box, you\u2019re already conditioned to expect the same experience. And the experience immediately reinforces the idea that you made a great decision. I can confidently say that no other manufacturer comes close \u2014 their packaging can be sheer frustration, and it can vary widely from one product to another. Consider the Studio Display. Often, unpacking and setting up a large display can be a real pain. Most often, you have to burrow through a Byzantine contraption to pull out the accessories and the stand, then carefully pry up the panel and set it somewhere to put everything together. You have a bunch of styrofoam to sort through and parts to unpack, and you have to be careful not to damage the glass as you wrestle it around. With the Studio Display, you unzip, lay the box down, swing open the sides, and the monitor is easily accessible and already assembled. Pick it up and set it on your desk, in one smooth motion. And then packing it back up is just as easy \u2014 something that\u2019s sheer frustration with every other monitor I\u2019ve reviewed. Now, imagine that you\u2019re also unboxing a Mac Studio. That box is designed exactly the same way, only smaller. Unzip it, swing open the sides, and easily lift it out. In all Apple products, the power cables are nicely arranged with the same kind of holder. It looks and feels great. In my recent review process, I unboxed two Mac Studios, two MacBook Air laptops, a Studio Display, a Magic Keyboard, a Magic Trackpad, and a Magic Mouse, all in quick succession. I came away impressed by the almost obsessive attention to detail and how it felt a little like Christmas morning \u2014 mission accomplished, I\u2019m sure. And when I need to box everything back up at some point, it will be just as easy. For anyone purchasing an Apple product, the unboxing process pulls them in via its simplicity and lack of hassle \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to get in the way of enjoying the product. The point isn\u2019t just that Apple creates a great unboxing experience, which is certainly true. Moreso, it\u2019s that this kind of persistent consistency extends across its entire product line. Consider the Mac Studio and Studio Display pictured above. They closely match in their aesthetic, and it looks great. They\u2019re both constructed of the same solid aluminum and the colors hint that they\u2019re made for each other. And that makes sense, because someone purchasing a Mac Studio might very well want an excellent monitor that maintains the same minimalist aesthetic. Both feel the same, as well. They\u2019re not light devices, exactly, but they\u2019re not egregiously heavy, either. But they\u2019re dense, and to me, that density equates with solidity, which equates with quality. That\u2019s an attribute that I\u2019ve attributed to Apple MacBooks in my reviews. No, they\u2019re not the lightest laptops you can buy, but they\u2019re thin and solidly constructed and so in handling them you you \u2014 once again \u2014 feel like you got your money\u2019s worth. The example that comes most immediately to mind is the MacBook Air 13 that I\u2019ve been using as my primary portable machine . I have some other thin-and-light laptops I can use, but none are so insanely thin and none feel so incredibly solid. Those laptops are lighter, yet somehow, the MacBook Air feels better balanced and easier to carry around, not only with the lid closed but also \u2014 and here, it\u2019s obvious how closely Apple\u2019s paying attention to how people use their laptops \u2014 with the lid open. Are Apple laptops necessarily more robust or longer lasting? Maybe not, I don\u2019t really know. But my impression is that they are, and for Apple, that\u2019s what matters the most when it comes time for someone to buy a laptop \u2014 or to buy the next one. There are many individual details I could talk about, like how the Mac Studio remains amazingly silent no matter how hard you push it, while the MacBook Air somehow doesn\u2019t turn into a toaster although it runs without a fan. There\u2019s the lid that opens smoothly with one hand and \u2013here\u2019s Apple paying attention again \u2014 closes even more smoothly. There\u2019s the cohesiveness in design between the various MacBook sizes and models, down even to the simple port cutouts, and the keyboards and touchpads are identical no matter which one you use. Even the notch is the same, even if many people just don\u2019t like it very much. The point is, all of these details, large and small, contribute to an overall experience that you might not even consciously notice. But, taken together, they\u2019re what makes using an Apple product just different somehow. When you handle so many of them at once, it becomes immediately apparent. I know I sound a lot like an Apple fan here, and that\u2019s not at all my intention. After all, if I\u2019m simply a fan of one company or another, then my reviews can\u2019t be trusted. And as I mentioned in the introduction, Apple\u2019s software has been a bit problematic lately. Apple Intelligence is a mess, macOS is stable as always but not always intuitive, and iPadOS is ridiculous in its inability to genuinely multitask with a fast M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM. So while Windows has been a hot mess for me lately, Apple hasn\u2019t exactly knocked its software out of the park, either. Rather, my point is that Apple\u2019s relentless attention to detail in its hardware makes a meaningful difference in how I perceive its products \u2014 starting from when I first open the box. I would be lying if I said that didn\u2019t impact my reviews, and really, it should. After all, people are looking for my recommendations as to which laptop they should buy, and there\u2019s more to using a laptop than its speeds and feeds. Of course, Apple\u2019s latest MacBooks excel in their performance and efficiency, as well. If the MacBook Air 13  wasn\u2019t really fast and really long-lasting, I wouldn\u2019t have given it a perfect score no matter how much I like its design. Apple doesn\u2019t do any of it for free, of course. Its products are more expensive \u2014 in some cases, a lot more expensive. The point of this entire piece is that at least in terms of its hardware, Apple has a knack for making you feel like you get what you pay for. Apple has announced two iPad models, the Mac Studio, and the MacBook Air so far this year, and out of all of these products, the Sky Blue MacBook Air is expected to sell the most. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says Apple is expecting high demand for all the latest devices but the new color option for the budget MacBook is expected to be particularly hot.  Ten years ago today, Apple unveiled the 12-inch MacBook to the world, claiming it had \u201creinvented the notebook\u201d for the better. The laptop almost instantly divided opinion, with fans and detractors at each other\u2019s throats from the start. And sure, it was by no means perfect, but look a little closer and I think you\u2019ll find a device that has had a monumental impact on the world of computing -- not just on Apple, but on the industry as a whole. The 12-inch MacBook is often seen as a flop and as a product emblematic of the excesses of Apple\u2019s Jony Ive era, where the design guru\u2019s penchant for thinness and lightness ruled all. The fact that this MacBook was discontinued after just four years is seen as proof of this idea. With the introduction of the new M4 MacBook Air, it's time to say goodbye to some of the older models. This time, both the M3 and the M2 MacBook Air will disappear from Apple Store shelves. Unlike the M3, however, the M2 isn't being discontinued completely -- it will still be available at certain retailers. This gives people a chance to get an amazing laptop  at a really good price. TechRadar has already spotted certain M2 MacBook Air configurations on Amazon selling for as low as $699. That's 30% off MSRP and 30% less than the new M4 model.

{"text": "AAPL: 205.04  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Apple CEO Tim Cook Last updated 2 days ago Even though the saga started after the fiscal quarter ended, Apple's Q2 financial results are going to be profoundly different thanks to the Trump tariffs. Here's what to expect from the results on May 1. As regular as clockwork, Apple will be reporting its Q2 2025 earnings on May 1, with the results released ahead of the standard analyst and investor conference call at 5p.m. Eastern. Apple's CEO Tim Cook will be on the call, along with newly-installed CFO Kevan Parekh, to discuss the results and to take on questions from analysts. Given the turbulent April Apple endured thanks to the introduction of tariffs against China and the rest of the world by President Donald Trump, Cook and Parekh will probably have a lot more questions about the supply chain than normal. Last quarter: Q1 2025 detailsThe Q1 results saw Apple report its highest figures for the year, including revenue growing year-on-year to $124.3 billion from $119.58 billion in the year-ago quarter. On a unit basis, iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year at $69.1 billion for the quarter, iPad rose from $7.02 billion to $8.088 billion, and Mac rose from $7.78 billion to $8.99 billion. Wearables, Home, and Accessories saw a small dip from $11.95 billion to $11.747 billion. Apple quarterly revenue and gross margin as of Q1 2025Services continued its growth streak, from $23.12 billion in Q1 2024 to $26.34 billion in Q1 2025. That quarter had a lot of preceding launches, including the iPhone 16 range, USB-C on AirPods Max, the Apple Watch Series 10, and the Black Apple Watch Ultra. Apple's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. The Earnings Per Share was listed at $2.41. On a regional basis, which is quite pertinent this time around, Greater China revenue saw a YoY dip from $20.8 billion to $18.513 billion. Year-ago quarter: Q2 2024Typically the benchmark for comparison for the current quarter's results, the Q2 2024 results were a bit of a dip for the company. Overall revenue of $90.75 billion was down from the previous Q2 2023's figure of $94.8 billion. Even so, there were quite a few positives. For a start, Apple beat Wall Street, with its consensus putting Apple's revenue at somewhere between $82.32 billion and $86.15 billion. Apple's EPS of $1.53 was up year-on-year from $1.52, and also beat Wall Street's forecast of $1.50. Apple quarterly unit revenue, as of Q1 2025That quarter had relatively few product launches, including the release of the Apple Vision Pro, as well as M3 Apple Silicon updates to the MacBook Air range. Revenue from iPhone was $45.96 billion, down YoY from $51.3 billion. Mac was flat, from $7.45 billion one year prior to $7.2 billion. There was a dip for iPad from $6.7 billion to $5.56 billion, while Wearables, Home, and Accessories shifted downward from $8.76 billion to $7.9 billion. Services kept up its growth trend, going from $20.9 billion in Q2 2023 to $23.9 billion in Q2 2024. What happened in Q2 2025As usual for the period, Apple had some product launches, including the iPhone 16e, the 11th-gen iPad, the M3 editions of iPad Air, the M4 MacBook Air, and an updated Mac Studio. While it won't have the same impact as in the massive Q1 results, there will still be the lingering effects of product launches from the end of 2024, including the iPhone 16 generation, a new iPad mini, and the November Mac launches. These will have a material impact on revenue in the Q2 results. Post-quarter Trump tariffsA current hot-button issue that will be raised during the analyst conference call, and that Apple will probably advise on, is the state of tariffs. After the quarter ended, the Trump administration decided to issue \"reciprocal tariffs\" against each country in the world. Given the volatile nature of the situation, it is almost certain that the tariffs, and what Apple can do to mitigate their effects on the supply chain as a whole, will dominate the analyst chatter. The tariffs were heralded very early in Apple's second quarter, but were not implemented until April, after the quarter ended. The tariffs won't impact the results of the quarter itself, but will almost certainly play a factor in Q3 and future quarter discussions. The tariff fight included a period of tit-for-tat rises, with Trump setting a high rate for China, then China fighting back with its own on imports from the U.S., followed by a response by Trump. The affair severely impacted Apple's stock price, with investors worried about the potential high price rises of Apple goods in the United States, caused by the tariffs. Eventually, Apple and other tech companies were given some respite in the form of an exception. This is, however, temporary until new \"semiconductor tariffs\" arrive in the future. China, meanwhile, was fed up of raising its tariff against U.S. goods, and went a different route. Instead, it ceased the exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, which can impact supply chains around the world. While investors may be worried about future iPhone pricing, it probably won't affect sales that much. Analyst research has determined that the intention to upgrade in the next 12 months is at an all-time high. However, that survey occurred in March, before the tariffs hit the world. Consumer opinion may have changed a lot since then. Wall Street ConsensusThe Wall Street consensus refers to a survey of analysts. The results are averaged out to give a general opinion of where investors and analysts are leaning in their quarterly forecasts for Apple. Yahoo Finance In the estimates published by Yahoo Finance as of April 29, 27 analysts offered an average revenue estimate of $94.42 billion. The estimated range goes from a high of $96.33 billion to a low of $90.06 billion. For the earnings per share, a group of 28 forecasts an average of $1.61, with a high of $1.66 and a low of $1.53. TipRanks On April 30, TipRanks offered its own consensus figures. The revenue forecast is at $94.25 billion, with a range from $89.4 billion to $96.33 billion.The earnings per share is expected to be $1.62, with a range from $1.47 to $1.67. Analyst ExpectationsAs Apple's results get closer to release, analysts offer what they believe will be included in the issued figures, and where Apple's future could lead for the coming year. Bank of America In an update reported on April 29, Bank of America reiterated a \"Buy\" rating for Apple. However, it also lowered the price target for the shares, from $250 to $240. Analysts cited uncertainty in the economic outlook, but still believed there would be some near-term upside for the quarter. Pull-forward of demand from tariff concerns is a bright point, but that could die down as economic worries become more of an issue for consumers as the months roll on. Evercore On April 28, Evercore ISI's note to investors previewed the quarter, insisting that Apple has a host of mitigation strategies to offset the impact of tariffs over time. While Apple is not expected to offer guidance beyond Q3, or to take a stance on where tariff rates will settle for the long term, Evercore still expects a Q3 guidance to be issued. Currently, the Q3 gross margins are expected to be guided down 50 to 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter, slightly below the 40 basis points of its consensus. The Q3 margin estimate is expected to be 46% down 100 basis points quarter-to-quarter or down 30 basis points year-on-year. Overall, Evercore maintained its \"Outperform\" rating for the stock, with a price target of $250. JP Morgan In an April 28 note to investors, JP Morgan analysts were feeling positive about AAPL, both for Q2 and Q3. For Q2, the revenue estimate was raised from $93.5 billion to $95.8 billion, while the earnings per share was upped from $1.59 to $1.66. The reasoning was a pull-forward of demand for Apple products due to the early-year threat of tariffs prompting earlier consumer upgrades, as well as for retailers to boost their inventories. The logic continues with the Q3, which JP Morgan believes is \"better than feared\" at $90.8 billion revenue, $1.51 EPS. The uncertainty of the tariff situation should equate to more pull-forward and higher sales, especially due to seeing the early effects of tariff decisions. At the time, JP Morgan maintained its \"Overweight\" rating and a $245 price target. Morgan Stanley In an April 28 note to investors, Morgan Stanley forecast that Apple should modestly exceed the consensus in Q2, but the tariff backdrop introduces some downsides to Q3. For the Q2 results, the forecast is $95.7 billion and an EPS of $1.64. Product pull-forward will have been strong because of the tariffs, as well as benefiting from a weaker dollar overall. Services is expected to grow 12% year-on-year. When it comes to Q3, Morgan Stanley too thinks that it will be a better-than-feared situation. Its model for the June quarter is for the \"volatile\" U.S. tariff policy to rest at a 20% tariff for all exempted products manufactured in China, which would affect iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and a 145% rate on Chinese AirPods, versus 10% for Vietnam-produced AirPods. Morgan Stanley considers Apple's stock to be \"Overweight\" with a price target of $235, up from $220. Goldman Sachs On April 23, Goldman Sachs lowered its price target from $259 to $256. It still maintained a \"Buy\" rating on the shares, despite the target cut. Goldman Sachs believes Apple should offer strong results thanks to new product innovation and channel fill, as well as a pull-forward caused by the tariff situation. Competitiveness between US carriers and good Services performance also stands to help Apple in the quarter. UBS On April 23, UBS slashed its stock price target for Apple from $236 down to $210. Despite the pessimism, UBS maintains a \"Neutral\" rating for Apple. The change was based on expected changes to tariffs, but the pessimistic viewpoint is still accompanied by hope for growth. A pull-forward in iPhone shipments may have increased growth by about 1 million units in the quarter, even though demand was apparently pretty flat. For the quarter, the overall revenue forecast was increased by 2% to $95.5 billion, from $93.5 billion previously. The EPS has also been increased in estimates, from $1.56 to $1.62. Wedbush On April 13th, Wedbush lowered its full-year earnings per share estimates for Apple, from $7.44 per share for the year to $7 flat. Wedbush's consensus estimate puts Apple at $7.28 for the full-year earnings Wedbush holds an \"Outperform\" rating for Apple, with a $250 price target. As regular as clockwork, Apple will be reporting its Q2 2025 earnings on May 1, with the results released ahead of the standard analyst and investor conference call at 5p.m. Eastern. Apple's CEO Tim Cook will be on the call, along with newly-installed CFO Kevan Parekh, to discuss the results and to take on questions from analysts. Given the turbulent April Apple endured thanks to the introduction of tariffs against China and the rest of the world by President Donald Trump, Cook and Parekh will probably have a lot more questions about the supply chain than normal. The Q1 results saw Apple report its highest figures for the year, including revenue growing year-on-year to $124.3 billion from $119.58 billion in the year-ago quarter. On a unit basis, iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year at $69.1 billion for the quarter, iPad rose from $7.02 billion to $8.088 billion, and Mac rose from $7.78 billion to $8.99 billion. Wearables, Home, and Accessories saw a small dip from $11.95 billion to $11.747 billion. Services continued its growth streak, from $23.12 billion in Q1 2024 to $26.34 billion in Q1 2025. That quarter had a lot of preceding launches, including the iPhone 16 range, USB-C on AirPods Max, the Apple Watch Series 10, and the Black Apple Watch Ultra. Apple's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. The Earnings Per Share was listed at $2.41. On a regional basis, which is quite pertinent this time around, Greater China revenue saw a YoY dip from $20.8 billion to $18.513 billion. Typically the benchmark for comparison for the current quarter's results, the Q2 2024 results were a bit of a dip for the company. Overall revenue of $90.75 billion was down from the previous Q2 2023's figure of $94.8 billion. Even so, there were quite a few positives. For a start, Apple beat Wall Street, with its consensus putting Apple's revenue at somewhere between $82.32 billion and $86.15 billion. Apple's EPS of $1.53 was up year-on-year from $1.52, and also beat Wall Street's forecast of $1.50. That quarter had relatively few product launches, including the release of the Apple Vision Pro, as well as M3 Apple Silicon updates to the MacBook Air range. Revenue from iPhone was $45.96 billion, down YoY from $51.3 billion. Mac was flat, from $7.45 billion one year prior to $7.2 billion. There was a dip for iPad from $6.7 billion to $5.56 billion, while Wearables, Home, and Accessories shifted downward from $8.76 billion to $7.9 billion. Services kept up its growth trend, going from $20.9 billion in Q2 2023 to $23.9 billion in Q2 2024. As usual for the period, Apple had some product launches, including the iPhone 16e, the 11th-gen iPad, the M3 editions of iPad Air, the M4 MacBook Air, and an updated Mac Studio. While it won't have the same impact as in the massive Q1 results, there will still be the lingering effects of product launches from the end of 2024, including the iPhone 16 generation, a new iPad mini, and the November Mac launches. These will have a material impact on revenue in the Q2 results. A current hot-button issue that will be raised during the analyst conference call, and that Apple will probably advise on, is the state of tariffs. After the quarter ended, the Trump administration decided to issue \"reciprocal tariffs\" against each country in the world. Given the volatile nature of the situation, it is almost certain that the tariffs, and what Apple can do to mitigate their effects on the supply chain as a whole, will dominate the analyst chatter. The tariffs were heralded very early in Apple's second quarter, but were not implemented until April, after the quarter ended. The tariffs won't impact the results of the quarter itself, but will almost certainly play a factor in Q3 and future quarter discussions. The tariff fight included a period of tit-for-tat rises, with Trump setting a high rate for China, then China fighting back with its own on imports from the U.S., followed by a response by Trump. The affair severely impacted Apple's stock price, with investors worried about the potential high price rises of Apple goods in the United States, caused by the tariffs. Eventually, Apple and other tech companies were given some respite in the form of an exception. This is, however, temporary until new \"semiconductor tariffs\" arrive in the future. China, meanwhile, was fed up of raising its tariff against U.S. goods, and went a different route. Instead, it ceased the exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, which can impact supply chains around the world. While investors may be worried about future iPhone pricing, it probably won't affect sales that much. Analyst research has determined that the intention to upgrade in the next 12 months is at an all-time high. However, that survey occurred in March, before the tariffs hit the world.

{"text": "Netflix has an ambitious financial goal that all but guarantees five years of price increases. Realistically, Netflix just being in business guarantees higher subscription prices over time, but this target comes with an aggressive deadline. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix has set two goals to achieve by 2030. Both are goals that Apple once set and achieved. First, Netflix wants to increase its market cap valuation from where it stands today at just below $500 billion to $1 trillion over the next five years. Netflix is valued at $479 billion today so it will need to more than double its market cap. How will Netflix double its valuation? That\u2019s where the second goal becomes relevant. Netflix also wants to double its revenue by 2030. While there are endless ways for Netflix to grow its revenue by 2x between now and 2030, the simplest money button to press has consistently been price increases over time. Harder tasks include growing the customer base, expanding the size of its relatively new advertising business, and entering new markets. Netflix could also add more features to the product. A recent example of this includes the addition of streaming video games. Perhaps Spotify and YouTube are models for what Netflix has in mind. Spotify expanded its advertising and subscription music business to include podcast exclusives and audiobook downloads. YouTube is powered by ads, but it also has a competing music subscription business, an ad-free tier, and a live TV package. Netflix has reconfigured its different membership tiers a lot in recent years, but it currently offers three options: Netflix with ads Standard Premium In the United States, these plans go for $7.99/month for Netflix with ads, $17.99/month for Standard, and $24.99/month for Premium. Netflix increased its plans by $1, $1.50, and $2 per month, respectively, back in January. Prior to January 2025, Netflix left prices unchanged since October 2023. Going 12-15 months without a price increase is possible, but that might be more surprising than if Netflix bumped prices again or added a higher-priced tier. People won\u2019t stop subscribing to Netflix, so Netflix won\u2019t stop raising prices. How high is too high? Between 2015 and 2025, Netflix increased the price of its premium tier from $11.99 to $24.99. One hopes that Netflix would need to bundle in additional content of significant value to viewers to bring the price to $30 in 2030, but the company has a track record of defying gravity when it comes to price jumps. I recently subscribed to Netflix after two years away. I will watch all of the new content over the next few months, then unsub and move on to another streaming service. That is how it should be done and what all of these price increases demand. That\u2019s also what makes the ad tier more interesting for the business. Netflix with ads has existed for less than two years, but it effectively makes the price of viewing on a single screen unchanged over 10 years. There\u2019s just, you know, ads. The ads tier has also helped soften the blow of the standard tier moving from $8.99 to $17.99 during the same period. Apple, of course, first reached the $1 trillion market cap milestone in August 2018. The company is now worth $3.17 trillion. Apple\u2019s big climb came after Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly told investors and analysts that the company planned to double its services revenue between January 2017 and 2020. App Store subscriptions and in-app purchases delivered for Apple. Netflix isn\u2019t being as direct with its mission to hit $1 trillion market cap and double its revenue. Below is the transcript that Netflix helpfully provides from its most recent earnings call: Spencer Wang Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations We\u2019ll now take questions from the analyst community, and we will begin first with our results, outlook and forecast. And our first question comes from Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson. Robert\u2019s question is, the Wall Street Journal report this week discussed Netflix\u2019s internal goal of doubling revenue and tripling operating income by 2030. How should investors think about Netflix leaning into more content spending over the next 5 years? Theodore A. Sarandos Co-CEO, President & Director I\u2019ll take this. And thanks, Robert. Look, we have a unique culture. And part of it is this open information operating style, and it has served us very, very well. On rare and very disappointing occasions, our confidential and internal discussions can leak into the press. And while we wouldn\u2019t normally comment about leaked internal information, we do want to be extra clear about this. We often have internal meetings and we talk about long-term aspirations. But it\u2019s important to note that this is not the same as forecast. Our operating plans is the same as our external forecast and guidance. We don\u2019t have a 5-year forecast or 5-year guidance. But you can assume that we are long-range thinking, and that we\u2019re working hard every day to build the most loved and valued entertainment company for all of our stakeholders. Gregory K. Peters Co-CEO, President & Director And maybe to pivot the conversation too \u2014 we\u2019re happy to comment on and discuss the detail. We do have big long-term aspirations and those aspirations are really grounded in the potential for growth that we see in the business. Now we think we\u2019ve got a pretty good business today, over $40 billion in revenue. We\u2019ve got over $300 million paid households. Those represent an audience of over 700 million individuals. We\u2019re leading in streaming view share. But we also think that we\u2019re a minority of our addressable market, our potential across any of those measures. If you think about engagement, we\u2019re less than 10% of TV hours for an audience or a connected households perspective. We still got hundreds of millions of folks to sign up. And from a revenue perspective, we\u2019re about 6% of consumer spend and ad revenue in the countries we serve in the areas that we serve. So we believe we\u2019ve got plenty of room to grow our engagement, our revenue and our profit. And as Ted said, do that to become the most valued and loved entertainment company for all of our stakeholders. While Apple doesn\u2019t provide its own earnings call transcript, we can always rely on Jason Snell at Six Colors to do the work for everyone.

{"text": "Good morning. If you should ever meet Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, never compare him to Elon Musk. Huang's biographer learned this the hard way. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump's tariffs have gone into effect \u2014 we're looking at when you can expect prices to rise, and how severe they may be. What's on deck Markets: Why \"The Big Short\" investor Steve Eisman thinks the US would prevail in a global trade war. Tech: How grassroots rage at Elon Musk snowballed into global protests. Business: Zillow might not be the place to look for your dream home anymore, thanks to new rules. But first, time for an upgrade? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. $1,549 for an iPhone. After Trump's latest round of tariffs \u2014 which went into effect today \u2014 UBS's chief investment officer said the Mainland China-assembled iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256 GB would likely see a price hike of $350. The White House's total tariff rate for China now stands at 104%. BI spoke to seven analysts about rising consumer prices and found they expect costs to go up roughly 30% to 50%. It's not just Apple, either. A slew of companies have talked about raising prices due to Trump's tariffs, including Walmart and Target \u2014 BI has a running list of them here. Prices on everything from pantry staples like coffee and sugar to larger purchases like cars and appliances are expected to rise. A Yale economist estimated that the cost to the average household could be about $3,800 this year. \"Shark Tank\" investor Mark Cuban has suggested Americans begin stockpiling goods before prices go up: \"From toothpaste to soap, anything you can find storage space for, buy before they have to replenish inventory,\" Cuban wrote. So, should you take Cuban's advice and stockpile essentials? Some Americans are. BI spoke with people who say they're buying makeup, skincare goods, pet food, spices, meat \u2026 the list goes on. Prices might not rise immediately. Companies may think twice before passing on the cost to consumers. Take Apple: Increasing prices could give competitors like Samsung \u2014 who are less affected by tariffs \u2014 a competitive edge, analyst Thomas Monteiro said. That said, if you know you'll need a new iPhone soon, it's not a bad idea to act now, BI's Ana Altchek writes. 1. \"The Big Short\" investor is bullish on Trump and the trade war. Steve Eisman thinks the US would win if tariff escalation develops into a full-on trade war. He's also confident President Trump could get everything he wants from negotiations \"if reasonable heads prevail.\" 2. To buy \u2014 or not buy \u2014 the dip. There might be a glimmer of hope for the investors suffering through the brutal market sell-off. History suggests stocks could very well shake off these losses, and Truist's chief market strategist agrees: \"This is not the time to be selling into panic.\" 3. History lessons about a looming bear market. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday amid a three-day skid triggered by Trump's tariffs. Goldman Sachs strategists argue the market is now flirting with an event-driven bear market. Here's what to expect if the stock market decisively enters one. 1. Rage against the  machine. Tesla Takedown protests began sprouting up in February and by the end of March, they had reached more than 250 cities and 13 countries. Here's how anti-Tesla momentum evolved. 2. The angel investors shaking up Silicon Valley. There's a strong correlation between the rising number of women in angel investor markets and more female entrepreneurs receiving angel investing capital. It might be the best way for them to take on tech's billionaire boys club. 3. Microsoft middle managers, beware.

{"text": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold yen-denominated debt worth $628 million on Friday, even as Japanese companies delayed bond issues amid roiling markets and a burgeoning trade war. The famed investor's conglomerate issued six tranches of bonds ranging from three to 30 years, and offered higher premiums than its last yen note issue in October, per a term sheet viewed by Reuters. Beverage makers Asahi and Suntory and Cup Noodle owner Nissin Foods postponed yen-bond issues they had planned for this week as President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs and threats of retaliatory duties tanked stocks and rattled bond markets worldwide. Buffett, famous for keeping his cool when others panic, forged ahead. The Berkshire CEO nearly doubled his company's stash of cash and Treasurys to more than $320 billion last year, as he pared key holdings such as Apple and Bank of America and halted stock buybacks. This latest fundraising fueled fresh speculation on social media that the bargain hunter is preparing to pounce as stock prices reel. \"Just wow,\" Larry McDonald, the author of \"The Bear Traps Report\" and former head of US macro strategy at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, posted on X. \"Buffett is loaded with cash and he's reaching into the margin account  in yen. Next 12 months - he's going to buy this puke festival with both hands.\" Berkshire has been issuing so-called samurai bonds since 2019 to finance its investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. Friday's yen deal was its smallest so far, which could reflect limited investor appetite given all the market turmoil. Buffett's company raised its stakes in the five largest \"sogo shosha\" in March, after he disclosed in his annual shareholder letter in February that the quintet had agreed to let Berkshire increase its ownership of each of them to more than 10%. The billionaire investor wrote that he and his team originally piled in because they were \"amazed\" at the companies' cheap valuations. Buffett also praised their use of capital, quality of management, and shareholder-friendly policies. He pointed to their responsible stock buybacks and dividend increases, and their more modest executive compensation compared to US counterparts. The famously long-term investor said he expected his planned successor Greg Abel and Abel's successors to keep Berkshire invested in the five companies for \"many decades\" to come. He also boasted that Berkshire had spent $13.8 billion on the positions, which were worth $23.5 billion, or 70%, more at the end of 2024. Moreover, Buffett said the five bets were poised to yield $812 million in dividends this year, dwarfing the $135 million of interest on yen bonds that Berkshire expected to pay. Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger, sang the Japan bet's praises on a podcast in 2023. \"If you're as smart as Warren Buffett, maybe two, three times a century, you get an idea like that,\" he said. \"It was like having God just opening a chest and just pouring money into it.\" Munger explained that Berkshire was able to borrow money for 10 years at 0.5% a year and use it to purchase stocks yielding roughly 5% in dividends annually, a type of investment known as a carry trade. Shares of all five Japanese trading houses have fallen this year with Mitsubishi down about 5%, Marubeni and Sumitomo down about 7%, Itochu down 16%, and Mitsui down 20%. They now trade close to where they did early last year, which could make them appealing targets to an investor with deep pockets and a love for deals.

You should expect iPhone prices to go up this year, even if tariffs don't go sky high. Apple may move its assembly of US phones to India, and many of its devices are currently exempt from reciprocal tariffs on China. So, does that mean iPhone prices won't go up? Don't bet on it -- and not just because of tariffs, say experts. \"The iPhone is due for a price increase,\" said CNET managing editor Patrick Holland, who's been reviewing phones for CNET since 2016. \"The entry level iPhone is $829 and has cost that much for years. The last time it had a price  was in 2020.\" If the price of an iPhone does inch up, you may not even realize it. \" probably be buried in the promotional deals or the installment plans,\" said Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's Worldwide Device Tracker suite, which includes mobile phones, tablets and wearables. \"Yes, it might cost 50 bucks more at some stage, but we spread that over time, and it's a monthly installment plan.\" It's been less than a month since President Donald Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, launching a roller-coaster ride of raising and pausing tariffs on imports from nearly 100 countries. That included triple-digit levies for China, where Apple currently produces most of its products. Even before Trump announced the tariffs, Apple's biggest suppliers in India had shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March, according to customs records. Trump ended up exempting smartphones and some other electronics from his reciprocal tariffs, leaving in place a 20% tariff on goods shipped from China. Some politicians have questioned this exemption, and last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook asking how Apple products were excluded after Trump said there would be no tariff exemptions. On top of this, Apple reportedly may source its iPhones for the US market from India by the end of 2026 -- although perhaps not all of them. India was among those reprieved temporarily from its 26% reciprocal tariff but is still subject to a 10% tariff on all imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that he expects India to be the first to secure a tariff deal, according to the New York Post. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Regardless of where tariffs end up, you should be prepared for potential price increases on electronics. We have alternative options to help you save on them, including the iPhone. If the full cost of current tariffs were passed on to shoppers, we could see anywhere from a 26% hike on Apple products manufactured in India to a 145% increase for those made in China. But currently, tariffs on goods from India have a 10% tariff and iPhones manufactured in China are still subject to Trump's 20% \"fentanyl tariff\" for the country's supposed role in allowing fentanyl to enter the US. Here's how that could potentially affect the price of the iPhone: But there's a lot more that goes into the price of an iPhone than simply where it's assembled. Apple sources components for its products from a long list of countries, which could face higher tariffs after the pause. And a tariff on goods doesn't necessarily mean prices will go up by the same amount. If companies want to stay competitive, they could absorb some of the costs to keep their prices lower. \"It won't be as high as 1-to-1 in terms of the tariff increases,\" Reith said. \"The math isn't as clear-cut as that on the tariffs.\" It's unclear exactly when prices could go up but if companies sell out of devices produced before the tariffs, they may have to increase prices on products in tariffed shipments. However, even if Apple can't avoid tariffs entirely, it has ways to offset the impact through its services -- including its music, news and data plans -- according to supply chain expert Joe Hudicka. \"Apple will likely absorb some of the tariff costs up front to keep sticker prices stable, then pass the rest on to consumers gradually through service bundles, device longevity and ecosystem upgrades,\" he said. \"Consumers will still pay, just not all at once.\" It's also unclear exactly how much of an impact the tariffs will have on prices for all smartphones. If rising prices cause demand to plummet, experts note that Apple and other producers could reduce their prices to stay competitive. Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports plus reciprocal tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" He quickly announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs but left the baseline levies in place. Trump's long touted tariffs as a way to even the trade deficit and raise revenue to offset tax cuts, although many economists say that tariffs could lead to higher prices and may end up hurting the US economy. Stock prices plummeted after Trump's announcement as markets reacted poorly to the sweeping tariffs. Trump has taken an especially hard stance on China, which was already subject to tariffs that Trump ordered during his first term in office. He started in February, imposing 20% in tariffs, then announced a 34% tariff on goods from China earlier this month. He added an additional 50% tariff before eventually landing on the 145% tariff against China. China has responded with its own tariffs after each of Trump's announcements. The US Customs and Border Protection listed some key consumer electronics exempted from the reciprocal tariffs this month, but Trump said that those products would still be subject to a 20% fentanyl tariff. White House officials said the reprieve from additional tariffs was temporary and that those products would instead be subject to a \"semiconductor tariff.\" Tariffs, in theory, are designed to financially impact other countries because their goods are being taxed. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the product, and this upcharge is usually -- but not always -- passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. If you already planned to buy a new iPhone, gaming console, MacBook or other tech, buying it now might save you money. But if you don't need a new phone immediately, Holland recommends waiting. \"If iPhone prices rise, know that, like cars, the prices for used iPhones will likely rise, too,\" he said. \"If Apple does raise its prices, you'll likely get more for your old iPhone when you trade it in, and that should offset any increased prices.\" If you don't have the cash on hand and are considering using a credit card or buy now, pay later plan just to avoid tariffs, make sure you have the money to cover the costs before you start accruing interest. With credit cards' average interest rates currently more than 20%, the cost of financing a big purchase could quickly wipe out any savings you'd get by buying before prices go up because of tariffs. \"If you finance this expense on a credit card and can't pay it off in full in one to two months, you'll likely end up paying way more than a tariff would cost you,\" said Alaina Fingal, an accountant, founder of The Organized Money and a CNET Money Expert Review Board member. \"I would recommend that you pause on any big purchases until the economy is more stable.\" One way to save on Apple products, even if prices go up, is to buy last year's model instead of the newest release or a used one. And trading or selling a used one can help offset the cost even more. \"Apple has leaned into that with its Certified Refurbished program, much like the auto industry's used car model,\" Hudicka said. \"This program helps extend the lifespan of devices, keeping customers in the Apple ecosystem longer while distributing the cost impact over time.\" Tiffany Connors Editor Tiffany Wendeln Connors is a senior editor for CNET Money with a focus on credit cards.

{"text": "The behind the scenes journalistic recaps of Apple\u2019s AI drama continues today at The New York Times. And in this latest report, blame for Apple\u2019s struggles to compete in AI is assigned to a surprising source: Luca Maestri and budget. Today Tripp Mickle at The New York Times has published a wide-ranging report outlining Apple\u2019s struggles in AI, Siri, the Vision Pro, and more. It covers much of the same ground as yesterday\u2019s The Information report, but there is an especially interesting new tidbit around Apple\u2019s slow AI start. John Giannandrea, Apple\u2019s AI head, reportedly sought approval in early 2023 to upgrade the company\u2019s GPU arsenal and faced some pushback. Tripp Mickle writes at The New York Times: At the time, Apple\u2019s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old \u2014 far fewer than the hundreds of thousands of chips being bought at the time by A.I. leaders like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, these people said. Mr. Cook approved a plan to double the team\u2019s chip budget, but Apple\u2019s finance chief, Luca Maestri, reduced the increase to less than half that, the people said. Mr. Maestri encouraged the team to make the chips they had more efficient. It seems remarkable that Maestri would be able to have such a huge impact on Apple\u2019s AI efforts. Especially considering Cook gave his own approval. Mickle continues: The lack of GPUs meant the team developing A.I. systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its A.I. development. Maestri is Apple\u2019s longtime CFO who recently stepped into a reduced role, likely as part of a slow retirement plan. While Maestri\u2019s oversight of Apple\u2019s finances makes him an important voice in the decision to increase GPU investment, it\u2019s wild that such a seemingly short-sighted move happened so recently. So a CFO curbed massive investment into something that back then showed every sign of tech bubble? In a company that has enough cash to invest if/when the tech proves that it's worth pursuing \"at all costs\". They clearly lost some on the stocks market volatile reaction, but are still very stable company. And so far LLMs didn't prove to be the revolution some expected . So, I guess it\u00b4s still too soon to judge if it was a good or bad move. Apple\u2019s growing R&D spend over the years, the importance of AI, and the company\u2019s huge cash flow all make a simple budget dispute seem hard to believe. Not that this one decision can be entirely blamed for Apple\u2019s slow AI uptake, of course. Mickle also highlights leadership struggles between Robby Walker, who formerly led Siri, and Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a senior executive in software. However, such a big scale back on what Giannandrea was asking for seems like an especially big error, in hindsight. How much do you think this GPU budget reduction hurt Apple\u2019s AI efforts?

{"text": "Stocks closed sharply down on Thursday as investors digested a wave of economic uncertainty, including tariff tensions, inflation data, and a string of downbeat corporate signals. The Nasdaq sank 4.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 3.5% and the Dow fell 2.5%. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, slid 4%. Big Tech led the losses: Apple fell more than 4%, Amazon dropped over 5%, and Tesla slumped more than 7%. Used-car retailer CarMax was one of the day\u2019s biggest losers, closing down 17% after a disappointing earnings report and broader concerns about the auto sector. Looking ahead, Friday will bring a wave of bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others set to report \u2014 offering fresh insight into credit conditions and consumer resilience. Investors will also parse new economic data, including producer price inflation figures, for clues about the path of interest rates. Markets fell sharply Thursday, giving back a big chunk of Wednesday\u2019s huge rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,693 points in early-afternoon trading, or about 4.2%, after its historic 3,000-point surge the day before, The S&P 500 fell 4.9%, and the Nasdaq dropped 5.7%, with shares of the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the retreat: Apple  stock slid 6%, Tesla  dropped 10%, and Amazon  fell more than 6.5%. Shopify  stock tumbled more than 9%. Used car stocks were hit especially hard after CarMax\u2019s earnings miss, with CarMax stock down almost 20% and Carvana  off 10%. The pullback reflects lingering skepticism around President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs, which arrived even more abruptly than the trade war policy itself. Markets seem reluctant to trust a policy pivot that arrived without warning \u2014 even as inflation data offered some welcome relief. The Consumer Price Index showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March, the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax\u2019s  fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations of $0.66 per share. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025\u2019s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase  will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins \u2014 the critical metrics that show how it\u2019s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment. Any signs of tightening credit or weakening consumer demand could ripple across the market. Wells Fargo\u2019s  numbers will offer a window into consumer lending, where even small shifts in behavior can signal broader household strain. With recession chatter back on the table, analysts are looking for clues about how the bank is adjusting its exposure. Asset manager BlackRock  will report amid surging volatility and massive swings in investor sentiment. Its earnings should reveal whether clients are retreating into cash or leaning into risk \u2014 and where the big money is flowing. Morgan Stanley  will round out the Friday slate, with attention on investment banking fees and deal activity. With M&A pipelines reportedly thinning and IPOs still scarce, the results could help gauge the depth of Wall Street\u2019s current dealmaking drought.

{"text": "Legal Issues Back in 2021, Apple mostly won the antitrust case that Epic brought against it, and the Ninth Circuit largely agreed. The court rejected most claims about Apple\u2019s App Store being an illegal monopoly. The company just had to make one small change: let developers tell users they could make purchases elsewhere. Simple enough. Instead, Apple apparently decided that the best response was to design elaborate schemes to make that \u201celsewhere\u201d as scary and expensive as possible, hide evidence of those schemes from the court, and then lie under oath about all of it. This strategy has worked out about as well as you\u2019d expect, leading to what may be one of the most scathing judicial opinions you\u2019ll ever read. As we noted at the time, this seemed like the correct outcome. Many of the antitrust claims from Epic seemed ridiculous and the court agreed, but the provisions forbidding app developers from even communicating to users that it was possible to do non in-app purchases seemed extremely restrictive and problematic. Apple should have been happy with this result. But Apple apparently was not. Yesterday, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued one of the most scathing rulings I\u2019ve ever seen a court issue, calling out what appears to be Apple\u2019s willful decision to disobey the injunction and play games to avoid doing the little bit it was required to do. Let\u2019s let the judge take it from here: To summarize: One, after trial, the Court found that Apple\u2019s 30 percent commission \u201callowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins\u201d and was not tied to the value of its intellectual property, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple\u2019s response: charge a 27 percent commission  on off-app purchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the commission for a period of seven days after the consumer linked-out of the app. Apple\u2019s goal: maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. Two, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple\u2019s response: impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page \u201cscare\u201d screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple\u2019s goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court\u2019s Injunction. In stark contrast to Apple\u2019s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein, more than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a violation. The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. Cook chose poorly? Yikes. Being referred for criminal contempt? Double yikes. This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers\u2019 ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases. Ouch. Apple has a history of engaging in malicious compliance to regulatory requirements, but this seems particularly egregious. The court\u2019s ruling reveals a deliberate three-part strategy by Apple: First, design a system that would appear compliant while actually maintaining their monopoly. Second, hide evidence of this strategy through dubious privilege claims. And finally, when caught, lie about it under oath. The deliberate nature of Apple\u2019s defiance is perhaps best captured in internal communications about their \u201cscare screen\u201d strategy. In Slack communications dated November 16, 2021, the Apple employees crafting the warning screen for Project Michigan discussed how best to frame its language.  Mr. Onak suggested the warning screen should include the language: \u201cBy continuing on the web, you will leave the app and be taken to an external website\u201d because \u201c\u2018external website\u2019 sounds scary, so execs will love it.\u201d  From Mr. Onak\u2019s perspective, of the \u201cexecs\u201d on the project, Mr. Schiller was at the top. .) One employee further wrote, \u201cto make your version even worse you could add the developer name rather than the app name.\u201d  To that, another responded \u201cooh \u2013 keep going.\u201d Again, Apple decided on the most anticompetitive option, that is, the \u201ceven worse\u201d option of including the developer\u2019s name rather than the app name \u2026 All of this was hidden from the Court and not revealed in the May 2024 evidentiary hearings. Apple folks tried to claim that when they said \u201cscary\u201d they didn\u2019t mean \u201cscary\u201d and really said that \u201cscary\u201d was \u201ca term of art\u201d rather than what everyone knows it means: Mr. Onak testified that \u201cin term of UX writing, the word \u2018scary\u2019 doesn\u2019t . . . mean the same thing as instilling fear.\u201d .) Rather, \u201cscary\u201d is a term of art that \u201cmeans raising awareness and caution and grabbing the user\u2019s attention.\u201d .) Mr. Onak repeatedly asserted that the team\u2019s goal was simply \u201cto raise caution so the user would have all the facts so that they can make an informed decision on their own.\u201d .) Mr. Onak\u2019s testimony was not credible and falls flat given reason, common sense, and the totality of the admitted exhibits. The designers\u2019 discussions contextualize their use of the word \u201cscary\u201d to indicate its ordinary meaning and, most applicable here, indicate the goal of deterring users as much as possible from completing a linked-out transaction. Beyond the psychological manipulation through the UI, Apple\u2019s strategy centered on implementing a 27% commission on outside purchases \u2014 just a 3% discount from their usual rate for on-platform purchases \u2014 while knowing full well this would make external payment options economically unviable for developers. Apple senior management held a meeting after the injunction was upheld by the Ninth Circuit, in which notes were taken, discussing two options: one where they didn\u2019t charge for off-platform purchases . The other one, which they went for, was to let them place the info more broadly, but take a 27% cut, rather than a 30% cut. Unfortunately for Apple, the notes for that meeting noted that a reason to reject the first proposal was that it would \u201ccreate competitive pressure.\u201d As the judge notes: that was exactly the point of the injunction, to create competitive pressure. So, Apple\u2019s meeting to figure out how to minimize competitive pressure can be seen as seeking to get around the injunction. And then, on top of that, Apple went with a combination of both proposals to make it designed to stymie the injunction\u2019s purpose. They included the link-out restrictions from the first proposal AND the commission from the second proposal. Even more damning, Apple\u2019s internal notes reveal that Apple  predicted that the 3% discount on commissions wouldn\u2019t be economically viable, because the cost to run your own payment setup would likely exceed that 3%. And, Apple already knew that no one would sign up for this because they had used similar off-site commission programs in Korea and the Netherlands: At the time, Apple also knew of the virtually nonexistent adoption rates of the Netherlands and Korea programs. Those, similar to the at-issue program, additionally suggested to Apple the non-viable economics of the proposed program. See Feb. 2025 Tr. 1407:1-5  . If you only have one developer, you don\u2019t have to say \u201croughly correct.\u201d There\u2019s no estimating there. But amazingly, it gets worse. Apple\u2019s internal documentation more or less admits that they might be violating the injunction with this approach: Crucially, at this point, Apple\u2019s notes reflect uncertainty about whether it could in fact impose a commission without violating the Injunction. In one slide deck, Apple\u2019s notes explain that \u201cf we decided and had the ability to charge a commission, we believe there would be very little developer adoption of link-out, assuming a scenario where we would give a cost of payments discount at 3%.\u201d .) Those same notes indicate that Apple planned to \u201come up with a couple of models in the spectrum of what we think the judge will accept\u201d but to \u201ctart with the minimum.\u201d The judge also points out that the exec who was pushing for the \u201cno commission\u201d approach, Phil Schiller, had closely followed the trial and read the injunction, while the execs pushing for the sketchy commission approach had not. Prior to the June 20 meeting, there were individuals within Apple who were advocating for a commission, and others advocating for no commission. .) Those advocating for a commission included Mr. Maestri and Mr. Roman. .) Mr. Schiller disagreed. .) In an email, Mr. Schiller relayed that, with respect to the proposal for \u201ca 27% commission for 24 hours,\u201d \u201cI have already explained my many issues with the commission concept,\u201d and that \u201cclearly I am not on team commission/fee.\u201d 29 Mr. Schiller testified that, at the time, he \u201chad a question of whether we would be able to charge a commission\u201d under the Injunction, a concern which he communicated. .) Unlike Mr. Maestri and Mr. Roman, Mr. Schiller sat through the entire underlying trial and actually read the entire 180-page decision. That Messrs. Maestri and Roman did neither, does not shield Apple of its knowledge  of the Court\u2019s findings. When faced with judicial scrutiny of these practices, Apple didn\u2019t just defend its actions \u2014 it launched an extraordinary campaign of document suppression and delay tactics that would ultimately backfire spectacularly. As testimony unfolded, and Apple attempted to justify its response, the Court became increasingly concerned that Apple was not only withholding critical information about its business decision for complying with the Injunction, but also that it had likely presented a reverse-engineered, litigation-ready justification for actions which on their face looked to be anticompetitive. The Court immediately ordered Apple to produce all injunction-compliance related documents And then Apple appeared to play games in providing the demanded documents: Apple engaged in tactics to delay the proceedings. The Court later concluded that delay equaled profits. By September 30, 2024, Apple represented that it had produced around 89,000 documents out of the 1.5 million it had reviewed and expected to produce a few thousand more by October 7, 2024.  Apple, however, had asserted privilege over more than a third of responsive documents\u2026. Magistrate Judge Hixon largely found Apple\u2019s privilege claims to be unsubstantiated after reviewing eleven exemplar documents .  Apple used this decision to delay further and \u201coffered\u201d to re-review all 57,000 documents for which it claimed privilege in full or in part. Ultimately, Apple withdrew approximately 42.1% of its privilege claims. Although Apple now tries to recast its re-review as \u201cof its own accord,\u201d that framing belies the reality that the documents should have never been withheld in the first instance.  Ultimately, Epic and Apple hired three special masters to review Apple\u2019s privilege claims after its re-review. But Apple\u2019s strategy of obstruction eventually crumbled, revealing something even more serious: executives appearing to deliberately lie under oath. The judge describes how Apple hired some consultants, \u201cAnalysis Group\u201d or \u201cAG,\u201d to conduct research on the value of their platform to try to find justification for the 27% costs charged to developers. They then told the court that they used that analysis as the basis of what to charge, even though the notes now prove that the decision was actually made about six months earlier. In other words, Apple execs appear to have lied under oath. On top of that, Apple execs claimed that they hadn\u2019t evaluated if external costs of a developer running their own payment setup would exceed the 3% discount, even though it has since come out that they very much did do that analysis, and it was a key part of the decision to only discount commissions by 3%. More lies: Despite its own considerable evaluation, during the first May 2024 hearing, Apple employees attempted to mislead the Court by testifying that the decision to impose a commission was grounded in AG\u2019s report. ; see also Dkt. No. 1324, Apple Trial Brief at 12.) The testimony of Mr. Roman, Vice President of Finance, was replete with misdirection and outright lies. He even went so far as to testify that Apple did not look at comparables to estimate the costs of alternative payment solutions that developers would need to procure to facilitate linked-out purchases. The Court finds that Apple did consider the external costs developers faced when utilizing alternative payment solutions for linked out transactions, which conveniently exceeded the 3% discount Apple ultimately decided to provide by a safe margin. ; Feb. 2025 Tr. 1627:15\u20131628:10  .) Apple did not rely on a substantiated bottoms-up analysis during its months-long assessment of whether to impose a commission, seemingly justifying its decision after the fact with the AG\u2019s report. Also, given that the decision to charge 27% commissions happened in July of 2023, and the AG report was only delivered in January of 2024 , the same Apple exec then apparently lied and claimed the commission decision was made after the report was delivered, which the now-revealed notes show was just blatantly false: Mr. Roman did not stop there, however. He also testified that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it would impose on linked-out purchases: Q. And I take it that Apple decided to impose a 27 percent fee on linked purchases prior to January 16, 2024, correct? A. The decision was made that day. Q. It\u2019s your testimony that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what \u2014 what fee it\u2019s going to impose on linked purchases? A. That is correct. .) Another lie under oath: contemporaneous business documents reveal that on the contrary, the main components of Apple\u2019s plan, including the 27% commission, were determined in July 2023. Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies. They did not seek to withdraw the testimony or to have it stricken . Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this Court. Ouch. There\u2019s a lot more as well, but the judge is rightly pissed off. She has issued an injunction making it pretty clear that Apple has to knock off all its tricks: PERMANENTLY RESTRAINS AND ENJOINS Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them, from: Normally, I would say some of those go a bit far in limiting certain things that Apple would be expected to do, but\u2026 given just how much Apple tried to lie and mislead the court, it\u2019s kinda what you\u2019d expect. It also says it will not put a stay on this assuming Apple appeals \u201cgiven the repeated delays and severity of the conduct.\u201d While Apple also has to pay for the special master that it and Epic had to bring in to review the falsely claimed \u201cprivileged\u201d documents, there aren\u2019t any other sanctions . And that\u2019s why there\u2019s a criminal referral. What makes this ruling so remarkable isn\u2019t just the scathing language or even the criminal referral \u2014 it\u2019s the sheer pointlessness of Apple\u2019s defiance. The company had won almost all of this case. All it had to do was make one small change. Instead, its executives chose to lie, obstruct, and treat the judicial system with contempt. Even with Tim Cook\u2019s recent cozying up to Trump and the Trump/Bondi Justice Department\u2019s tendency to view justice through the lens of personal loyalty , it\u2019s hard to understand what Apple thought it would gain through such brazen actions. Yes, Apple managed to drag out its monopoly rents on app commissions for a bit longer. But it could have crafted a more open system that would have satisfied the court while preserving significant control over its platform  \u2014 all without executives potentially facing criminal contempt charges. The short-term profits from delay hardly seem worth the cost of credibility with courts and regulators going forward. As Judge Gonzalez Rogers put it simply: Tim Cook chose poorly. Filed Under: alex roman, antitrust, app store, competition, contempt, criminal contempt, in app purcases, luca maestri, obstuction, phil schiller, tim cook, yvonne gonzalez rogers Companies: apple It\u2019s fun watching all the apple fanatics get mad at this. They don\u2019t want to acknowledge that had apple not been 200% greedy it would not of gotten the nuclear option against it. Will Tim be kind enough with \u201cThe National Treasure Donald\u201d to avoid some prison time? To be continued\u2026 \u201dThink different\u201d was meant to be an ad slogan about Apple\u2019s technological ethos, not a confession of how they choose to \u201ccomply\u201d with court orders! implementing a 27% commission on outside purchases \u2014 just a 3% discount from their usual rate for on-platform purchases Their usual rate is 30%. 27% is a 10% discount from that rate . It could also be validly described as 3 percentage points, but not \u201c3%\u201d. It\u2019s been given as a percentage of the total price. Because that\u2019s the value that matters when it comes to developers setting up other payment methods. \u201cscary\u201d is a term of art that \u201cmeans raising awareness and caution and grabbing the user\u2019s attention.\u201d The designers\u2019 discussions contextualize their use of the word \u201cscary\u201d to indicate its ordinary meaning and, most applicable here, indicate the goal of deterring users as much as possible from completing a linked-out transaction. I don\u2019t fully understand the hair-splitting here. Some definitions of \u201cscary\u201d I\u2019ve found are \u201ccausing fear or alarm\u201d and \u201cCausing fear or anxiety\u201d . Definitions of \u201ccaution\u201d include \u201cPrudence when faced with, or when expecting to face, danger\u201d and \u201cgreat care which you take in order to avoid possible danger\u201d. So, how\u2019s Apple\u2019s definition really much better for Apple? Even if we accept their definition, they were trying to make people think an action was dangerous . What\u2019s the worse \u201cusual\u201d definition? And is anyone here scared of an \u201cexternal website\u201d, or of company names? I don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s all in how you present something. Example: You wouldn\u2019t want a stranger showing up at your door, would you? \u201cit\u2019s hard to understand what Apple thought it would gain through such brazen actions\u201d 3-4 more years of profits? I don\u2019t know if this opens Apple up to a class action lawsuit for developers to sue for their 30% from the last several years, in light of this ruling. It\u2019s telling that Patreon has already announced a new version of their iOS app which removes Apple\u2019s payment processing. Apple didn\u2019t comply with the court\u2019s ruling. In exchange, they gained several years of continued profits, and have so far lost nothing. A handful of individual people of no fundamental importance to Apple face hypothetical future losses of $1000 and 6 months in jail. Apple itself, its board, and its shareholders, face no hypothetical future losses at all. It sounds like this is another win for Apple. I predict that Apple is just going to defy this latest court order and proceed with more business as usual. Big corporations just love to pretend that they are the actual government. So\u2026 not providing information, nor allowing reasonable links to information, is making sure people are informed? Yeah sure thanks Elmer FUD. Apple already sent out emails to us developers with the new rules. They are for the Murican store only. Why would they chose such an obtuse example for external links in \u201cother calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others\u201d? They will not learn a lesson from this. I\u2019ve been a Mac person since 1987. I\u2019m not such a fan that feel any need to rush out and buy the latest product but it\u2019s fair to say that the next whatever is more likely to be from Apple than any other manufacturer. However, I have never been a fan of the App Store 30%. I\u2019ve always seem it as something outrageous that Apple decided to do simply because it could and where the iPhone was the perfect \u201clock down\u201d vehicle; and which they would love to extend to the Mac. So, for me, the fact that Apple just got a serious whack from the courts is something that should have happened 20 years ago, had regulators not been asleep at the switch and foreseen the anti-competitive nature of the whole plan. Ultimately, I hope Apple is  hung, drawn and quartered, with a serious message being sent to the entire tech sector that consumer choice must be preeminent. I\u2019ve also long been of the opinion that many corporate execs park their consciences at the door when they come to work and fully expect to hide behind the corporate shield, and that the only way to deal with this problem is to haul them out of their offices and throw them in the pokey. Incarcerate one, educate a thousand! Instead, Apple apparently decided that the best response was to design elaborate schemes to make that \u201celsewhere\u201d as scary and expensive as possible, hide evidence of those schemes from the court, and then lie under oath about all of it. This strategy has worked out about as well as you\u2019d expect Honestly, I almost don\u2019t blame them, with how limp U.S. courts have been on antitrust. They usually bend over backwards, so why not on this too? If you always get what you want, you start to take it for granted. But it could have crafted a more open system that would have satisfied the court while preserving significant control Therein lies the problem, for Apple. They\u2019re control freaks, and are used to getting their way on the tiniest details if it throws it\u2019s weight around. sidenote: that first techcrunch link 404\u2019s. Always remember, any fine less than the amount gained from the violation isn\u2019t a penalty, it\u2019s a cost of doing business. As several others have pointed out Apple violated the judge\u2019s orders and as a result got to profit heavily for it. They probably didn\u2019t expect the chance of jail time but it\u2019s not like anyone important to the company is likely to end up in a cell for an appreciable amount of time, and with the odds that they\u2019ll be fined even 100% of what they gained basically non-existent why wouldn\u2019t they choose this path? Not exactly. And not regarding Apple lying or obstructing. I am not opining on whether, how or why Apple execs lied. But, on policy, the Epic lawsuits and related app developer efforts targeting Apple and Google in other jurisdictions, which claimed to target Apple\u2019s  monopoly over \u201cin-app payments services\u201d, were always disingenuous. Epic and other big app developers never wanted to process payments, they wanted to circumvent Apple\u2019s  30% commissions. Payments was just a collection method Apple and Google used rather than adopt a bill-and-collect regime. So, Apple won in federal court on the in-app payments monopoly case. Google lost. However, Apple did lose one count under California law, on the topic of steering. Judge Gonzalez-Rogers made it very clear throughout the case that she objected to Apple\u2019s anti-steering rules. Although she could not find Apple in violation of federal antitrust law, she argued the broader California Unfair Competition statute worked. So she issued a short injunction prohibiting Apple from engaging in anti-steering conduct related to all apps in the US. Her injunction did not speak to commissions. She did not rule that Apple could not charge commissions of any particular level. So, while this was all going on, Apple, under pressure from large app developers in many global jurisdictions, were developing a response for jurisdictions where they were ordered to open up to payments alternatives. The Netherlands were key to them, due to an antitrust complaint filed by Match Inc where Apple lost.  Long story short, Apple, who believes they have every right to charge app developers 30% for using their platform , basically took their 30% rate and discounted 3%, which is on the order of what an online business would be charged by a payment processor like Stripe or Adyen. So, 27%. Google did the same in South Korea, although I think they landed on 26%. Judge Gonzalez-Rogers does seem to think that her original decision was a de facto ruling against Apple\u2019s fee level. She\u2019s the one who wrote it, so she can think that. But it\u2019s pretty questionable that she thinks she can determine and regulate how Apple can fund its highly successful iPhone ecosystem which she ruled is not a monopoly. Especially now that she orders a 0% commission. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Have a Techdirt Account? Sign in now. Want one?

You should expect iPhone prices to go up this year, even if tariffs don't go sky high. Apple may move its assembly of US phones to India, and many of its devices are currently exempt from reciprocal tariffs on China. So, does that mean iPhone prices won't go up? Don't bet on it -- and not just because of tariffs, say experts. \"The iPhone is due for a price increase,\" said CNET managing editor Patrick Holland, who's been reviewing phones for CNET since 2016. \"The entry level iPhone is $829 and has cost that much for years. The last time it had a price  was in 2020.\" If the price of an iPhone does inch up, you may not even realize it. \" probably be buried in the promotional deals or the installment plans,\" said Ryan Reith, group vice president for IDC's Worldwide Device Tracker suite, which includes mobile phones, tablets and wearables. \"Yes, it might cost 50 bucks more at some stage, but we spread that over time, and it's a monthly installment plan.\" It's been less than a month since President Donald Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, launching a roller-coaster ride of raising and pausing tariffs on imports from nearly 100 countries. That included triple-digit levies for China, where Apple currently produces most of its products. Even before Trump announced the tariffs, Apple's biggest suppliers in India had shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March, according to customs records. Trump ended up exempting smartphones and some other electronics from his reciprocal tariffs, leaving in place a 20% tariff on goods shipped from China. Some politicians have questioned this exemption, and last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook asking how Apple products were excluded after Trump said there would be no tariff exemptions. On top of this, Apple reportedly may source its iPhones for the US market from India by the end of 2026 -- although perhaps not all of them. India was among those reprieved temporarily from its 26% reciprocal tariff but is still subject to a 10% tariff on all imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that he expects India to be the first to secure a tariff deal, according to the New York Post. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Regardless of where tariffs end up, you should be prepared for potential price increases on electronics. We have alternative options to help you save on them, including the iPhone. If the full cost of current tariffs were passed on to shoppers, we could see anywhere from a 26% hike on Apple products manufactured in India to a 145% increase for those made in China. But currently, tariffs on goods from India have a 10% tariff and iPhones manufactured in China are still subject to Trump's 20% \"fentanyl tariff\" for the country's supposed role in allowing fentanyl to enter the US. Here's how that could potentially affect the price of the iPhone: But there's a lot more that goes into the price of an iPhone than simply where it's assembled. Apple sources components for its products from a long list of countries, which could face higher tariffs after the pause. And a tariff on goods doesn't necessarily mean prices will go up by the same amount. If companies want to stay competitive, they could absorb some of the costs to keep their prices lower. \"It won't be as high as 1-to-1 in terms of the tariff increases,\" Reith said. \"The math isn't as clear-cut as that on the tariffs.\" It's unclear exactly when prices could go up but if companies sell out of devices produced before the tariffs, they may have to increase prices on products in tariffed shipments. However, even if Apple can't avoid tariffs entirely, it has ways to offset the impact through its services -- including its music, news and data plans -- according to supply chain expert Joe Hudicka. \"Apple will likely absorb some of the tariff costs up front to keep sticker prices stable, then pass the rest on to consumers gradually through service bundles, device longevity and ecosystem upgrades,\" he said. \"Consumers will still pay, just not all at once.\" It's also unclear exactly how much of an impact the tariffs will have on prices for all smartphones. If rising prices cause demand to plummet, experts note that Apple and other producers could reduce their prices to stay competitive. Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports plus reciprocal tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" He quickly announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs but left the baseline levies in place. Trump's long touted tariffs as a way to even the trade deficit and raise revenue to offset tax cuts, although many economists say that tariffs could lead to higher prices and may end up hurting the US economy. Stock prices plummeted after Trump's announcement as markets reacted poorly to the sweeping tariffs. Trump has taken an especially hard stance on China, which was already subject to tariffs that Trump ordered during his first term in office. He started in February, imposing 20% in tariffs, then announced a 34% tariff on goods from China earlier this month. He added an additional 50% tariff before eventually landing on the 145% tariff against China. China has responded with its own tariffs after each of Trump's announcements. The US Customs and Border Protection listed some key consumer electronics exempted from the reciprocal tariffs this month, but Trump said that those products would still be subject to a 20% fentanyl tariff. White House officials said the reprieve from additional tariffs was temporary and that those products would instead be subject to a \"semiconductor tariff.\" Tariffs, in theory, are designed to financially impact other countries because their goods are being taxed. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the product, and this upcharge is usually -- but not always -- passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. If you already planned to buy a new iPhone, gaming console, MacBook or other tech, buying it now might save you money. But if you don't need a new phone immediately, Holland recommends waiting. \"If iPhone prices rise, know that, like cars, the prices for used iPhones will likely rise, too,\" he said. \"If Apple does raise its prices, you'll likely get more for your old iPhone when you trade it in, and that should offset any increased prices.\" If you don't have the cash on hand and are considering using a credit card or buy now, pay later plan just to avoid tariffs, make sure you have the money to cover the costs before you start accruing interest. With credit cards' average interest rates currently more than 20%, the cost of financing a big purchase could quickly wipe out any savings you'd get by buying before prices go up because of tariffs. \"If you finance this expense on a credit card and can't pay it off in full in one to two months, you'll likely end up paying way more than a tariff would cost you,\" said Alaina Fingal, an accountant, founder of The Organized Money and a CNET Money Expert Review Board member. \"I would recommend that you pause on any big purchases until the economy is more stable.\" One way to save on Apple products, even if prices go up, is to buy last year's model instead of the newest release or a used one. And trading or selling a used one can help offset the cost even more. \"Apple has leaned into that with its Certified Refurbished program, much like the auto industry's used car model,\" Hudicka said. \"This program helps extend the lifespan of devices, keeping customers in the Apple ecosystem longer while distributing the cost impact over time.\" Tiffany Connors Editor Tiffany Wendeln Connors is a senior editor for CNET Money with a focus on credit cards.

{"text": "Login Prasad 01 May 2025 Apple iOS A US district judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled today that, starting immediately, Apple is no longer allowed to tax external payment links within App Store titles nor can it restrict how they appear within the apps. This ruling came out of the longstanding Apple vs. Epic Games legal dispute, which has been going on for over four years now. While an earlier ruling was in Apple's favor, the latest one is a victory not just for Epic but all developers looking to distribute their apps within the US iOS App Store and do not want to pay Apple for using its payment systems. As part of this latest ruling, Apple can no longer impose any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app. It also cannot restrict developers' style, formatting, or placement of links for purchases outside of an app nor can it block or limit the use of buttons or other calls to action. Apple also cannot interfere with consumers' choice to leave an app with anything beyond a neutral message apprising users that they are going to a third-party site. It did not help Apple's case that the company's VP of Finance, Alex Roman, was found lying under oath, and that company CEO Tim Cook knowingly advocated defying the court's original 2021 ruling despite Apple Fellow Phil Schiller suggesting otherwise. Apple has responded to this ruling stating that \u201cWe strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court\u2019s order and we will appeal.\u201d Originally, Apple required developers distributing their apps through its App Store to force all users to use Apple's own payment system for any purchases made within the app. As with the purchase of the app itself, any in-app purchases were also taxed 30% of the total purchase amount, which Apple pocketed. Developers were prevented from having links to external purchase pages within their apps or even hint at such pages existing, and when a later ruling prevented the company from doing that it resorted to scare tactics every time a user tried to click on an external payment link. And even the external payment was subjected to a 27% tax. Epic \u2014 and also Spotify, which has had its own run-ins with Apple on similar matters \u2014 have issued statements that they are pleased with this decision and will be updating their apps immediately.

{"text": "Even before President Trump\u2019s tariffs threatened to upend Apple\u2019s manufacturing business in China, the company\u2019s struggle to make new products was leading some people inside its lavish Silicon Valley headquarters to wonder whether the company had somehow lost its magic. The tariffs, which were introduced April 2, caused Apple to lose $773 billion in market capitalization in four days and briefly lose its standing as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. But investors had already started to sour on the company, sending its share price down 8 percent in the first four months of the year, double the S&P 500\u2019s decline. Apple had hoped to revive its fortunes over the past year with a virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, and an artificial intelligence system called Apple Intelligence. Sales of the headset have been a disappointment, however, and the signature features of the A.I. system have been postponed because it didn\u2019t work as well as the company had expected. The company\u2019s issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers. And company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers. Apple declined to comment. It has been a decade since the releases of Apple\u2019s most recent commercial successes: the Apple Watch and AirPods. Its services like Apple TV+ and Fitness+, which it introduced in 2019, lag behind rivals in subscriptions. Half of its sales still come from the iPhone, an 18-year-old product that is incrementally improved nearly every year. While Vision Pro sales have been disappointing, Apple\u2019s issues with Apple Intelligence exposed dysfunction inside the organization. In a nearly two-hour video presentation last summer, Apple demonstrated how the A.I. product would summarize notifications and offer writing tools to improve emails and messages. It also revealed an improved Siri virtual assistant that could combine information on a phone, like a message about someone\u2019s travel itinerary, with information on the web, like a flight arrival time. The A.I. features were unavailable when new iPhones shipped. They arrived in October, about a month late, and quickly ran into trouble. Notification summaries misrepresented news reports, leading Apple to disable that feature. Then, last month, the company postponed the spring release of an improved Siri because internal testing found that it was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests, said three people familiar with the project who spoke on the condition of anonymity. After the delay, Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s software chief, told employees that the company would reshuffle its executives, removing responsibility for developing the new Siri from John Giannandrea, the company\u2019s head of A.I., and giving it to Mike Rockwell, the head of its Vision Pro headset. \u201cApple needs to understand what happened because this is bigger than just rearranging the deck chairs,\u201d said Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst who previously worked as a product marketer at Apple. \u201cIf ever there\u2019s been an example of over-promising and under-delivering, it\u2019s Apple Intelligence.\u201d It was the first time in years that Apple hadn\u2019t shipped a product it had unveiled. Some details of Apple\u2019s changes to its Siri team and challenges were previously reported by Bloomberg and The Information. The A.I. stumble was set in motion in early 2023. Mr. Giannandrea, who was overseeing the effort, sought approval from the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, to buy more A.I. chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, five people with knowledge of the request said. The chips, which can perform hundreds of computations at the same time, are critical to building the neural networks of A.I. systems, like chatbots, that can answer questions or write software code. At the time, Apple\u2019s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old \u2014 far fewer than the hundreds of thousands of chips being bought at the time by A.I. leaders like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, these people said. Mr. Cook approved a plan to double the team\u2019s chip budget, but Apple\u2019s finance chief, Luca Maestri, reduced the increase to less than half that, the people said. Mr. Maestri encouraged the team to make the chips they had more efficient. The lack of GPUs meant the team developing A.I. systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its A.I. development. At the same time, leaders at two of Apple\u2019s software teams were battling over who would spearhead the rollout of Siri\u2019s new abilities, three people who worked on the effort said. Robby Walker, who oversaw Siri, and Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a senior executive with the software team, struggled over who would have responsibility for some aspects of the project. Both ended up with pieces of the project. The infighting followed a broader exodus of talent from Apple. In 2019, Jony Ive, the company\u2019s chief designer, left to start his own design firm and poached more than a dozen integral Apple designers and engineers. And Dan Riccio, the company\u2019s longtime head of product design who worked on the Apple Watch, retired last year. In their place, Apple has been left with old and new leaders with less product development experience. Mr. Giannandrea, who joined the company in 2019 from Google, had never led the launch of a high-profile product like the improved Siri. And Mr. Federighi, his counterpart overseeing software, had never led the creation of a new operating system like some of his predecessors in that role. Mr. Cook, 64, who has a background in operations, has been hesitant over the years to provide clear and direct guidance on product development, said three people familiar with the way the company operates. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a breakdown of leadership and communication and internal processes,\u201d said Benedict Evans, an independent analyst who previously worked as a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz. Apple hasn\u2019t canceled its revamped Siri. The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said. Some of Apple\u2019s leaders don\u2019t think the delay is a problem because none of Apple\u2019s rivals, like Google and Meta, have figured out A.I. yet, these people said. They believe there\u2019s time to get it right. As the clock ticks on fixing Siri, Apple will be defending the assistant\u2019s current shortcomings. Last month, customers filed a federal lawsuit accusing Apple of false advertising. Since then, its commercials about Siri have gone dark. Brian X. Chen contributed reporting.

This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio 00:00:17  This week on the podcast, Jeff Becker, chairman and CEO of Jenison Associates, they\u2019re part of the PG Im family of Asset Managements. Jenison manages over $200 billion in assets. Jeff has really a fascinating background from Arthur Anderson to Aetna to Altas to ING. Eventually, he becomes CEO of Voya when the parent company spun out the US holdings into a separate entity, really an a, a fairly unique career path and is sort of uniquely situated to look at the world of investing. Jenison launched way back in 1969 as a growth equity shop. Their focus is on generating alpha with high conviction concentrated portfolios. They put up a damn good track record over the years. I thought this conversation was really interesting. There aren\u2019t many people who have this sort of perspective and perch to see the world of investing from both an institutional and insurance based perspective and a long, long-term retail investment perspective. I thought this conversation was really interesting, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Jenison Associates, Jeff Becker. So let\u2019s start with your background. You get a bachelor\u2019s in economics from Colgate and then an MBA in finance from NYU Stern. Sounds like you had been thinking about finance as a career right from the start. 00:02:02  Quite the contrary, Barry. I had no idea what I wanted to do in college or coming outta college. I was a liberal arts major. My parents felt strongly about getting, you know, me a liberal arts degree and having me learn how to read and write effectively. And so that was the goal. I was an economics and English major. Econ was the closest thing you could get to business in, in some of those schools. And so, you know, that\u2019s what I majored in. You know, I had no real guidance in terms of finance. Neither of my parents were in the financial industry. And so I did what most students did in those days, as you saw on the board, who was coming up to interview and, and potentially hire undergrads. And, and I saw that the, what were in those days, the big eight accounting firms were coming up to hire and they had this program where they would hire liberal arts graduates, have them work, and as part of the arrangement would pay for you to go to grad school. So it was a combined program through Arthur Anderson to go to NYU. And they were originally paying for a master\u2019s in accounting, but ultimately everyone parlayed that into an MBA in finance. Huh, 00:03:12  Really interesting. And did you end up at Arthur Anderson for any length of time? 00:03:16  I did. I did. I ended up there for, for seven years. It was a, it was a terrific experience. It was a, a great company. You know, in those days these companies hired, you know, crops of undergrads. They, they trained them together. We learned everything, you know, across from accounting to auditing to, to tax and valuation. I ended up in what was called the valuation services group, where we valued real estate and businesses either for transactions or for m and a activity. And it was a, a terrific company, a great learning experience. They sent you out to clients very early on in your career, and you also got people management skills pretty early on. 00:03:55  So learning to value real estate, learning to value companies, sounds like you\u2019re going into private equity and private credit down the road like that seems to be the path these days. What was that experience like and how did it affect how you look at investments today? 00:04:15  You would\u2019ve thought that I didn\u2019t know what private equity or private credit really was at the time. I had started to shift more and more into real estate. The background of tearing apart financial statements and balance sheets and discounted cash flow analysis was a great foundation really for anything in you do in finance ultimately. So it was a great experience in, in that regard. But I was starting more and more to specialize in real estate. And as a result, I got hired away by one of Anderson\u2019s clients, which was Aetna. And Aetna had a very large commercial real estate business. As you, as you may recall, the insurance companies had huge commercial loan portfolios in those days that they were using to backstop long dated life insurance liabilities. It seemed like the perfect match of asset and liabilities until real estate valuations bottomed out. And the life companies ended up with a whole bunch of mortgage loans that, that were underwater. That led to a terrific experience for me being part of the workout of all of those loans in the early nineties. So we did foreclosures, we did restructurings, we did equity kickers, and we pulled up some of these loans into CMBS deals and sold them, sold them through Wall Street. It was really a terrific experience and really bred out of a crisis. 00:05:36  And I just wanna emphasize, we\u2019re not talking the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. We\u2019re not talking about the financial crisis in oh 8, 0 9. You\u2019re talking about really the post SNL crisis, late eighties, early nineties, where a ton of commercial real estate suddenly took a big hit. Eventually you become Chief credit officer covering real estate at Aetna. Tell us a little bit about that. 00:06:02  Yeah, I was, I was part of, you know, the, the management that ultimately had to determine, you know, the valuation and, and the, the credit approval of the different transactions that we were working on, whether that was originally putting out new mortgage loans and determining whether it was a, you know, a good credit for, for the insurance company capital, or when we got into the restructuring period, it was about was this the right deal? Was were these the right terms, you know, for us as we, as we tried to salvage the portfolio. 00:06:32  And then following Aetna, you end up at Altus Investment Manager, your, your CFO there. What was that like going from analyzing credit to being chief financial officer for an investment firm? 00:06:46  Well, one of the things we were doing by working out the, the troubled mortgage loan book at Aetna is we were also working ourselves out of a job. So the job was to wind down the portfolio, and we were actually given retention agreements that were two years in duration. And at the end, we essentially were out of jobs. That was a little bit scary for an early career endeavor, but by the same token, it was the first time in my life I ever saw a six figure payment come at one time. And it was, it was quite, quite rewarding at an early stage in my career. So I knew I was gonna be out of a job. Aetna was up in, in Hartford, Connecticut. So I was up there alone as a, as a, as a young man. And I went to the head of HR at Aetna and I said, this has been a terrific experience, but my, my gig is up and I\u2019m probably gonna head back to New York City. 00:07:40 Is there anything that I should look at within Aetna? She happened to be a Colgate grad, took an interest in in me as a Colgate grad, and said, yeah, we\u2019ve got this great little third party institutional investment manager named Altus Investment Management. It runs pretty independently, has about a hundred billion in assets I\u2019m gonna send you over there to meet the young dynamic CEO there, a guy named John Kim. So I went over and met John, we had a, a terrific three hour conversation, and at the end of the conversation he said, you\u2019re hired. And I said, I\u2019m hired, what am I gonna do? And he said, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll figure it out, but I think you\u2019re gonna be CFO. And I said, well, I know Arthur Anderson is on my resume, but I I actually have never practiced accounting, and so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right role for me. And he said, well, we\u2019ve got a really strong finance team and a good strong controller. I want you to be a more strategic CFO, I want you to work on structured deals, m and a, you know, levers of profitability. And so that turned into a CFO role, which again, is a, is a terrific experience for anything you do. Really understanding how businesses make money and the levers of profitability is, is, is, is a great experience. Huh. 00:08:50  So how do you go from Altus to ING investing management? What, what was that transition like? 00:08:57  Well, in 2003, ING acquired Aetna\u2019s financial businesses, and that was the life insurance, retirement and asset management businesses. And so Altus went along with that, with that acquisition. ING had been on a buying spree around the world and in the US buying up insurers and, and other businesses. And had ultimately ended up with about six asset managers, brands that are now all gone. Altus. The one I came to the party with, Pilgrim Furman sells Lexington Partners, Relias Star Research, the original ING investment management. But, but ING did not wanna see these run as, as boutiques ultimately in the long run, ING had a very integrated model, a mono brand approach to the world, and wanted to bring all these asset managers together. So I was selected to help lead the integration of these asset managers, which was, which was an interesting project. Each of these asset managers had A-A-C-E-O. 00:10:01 These boutiques were pretty fiercely independent, and it was a bit of a bumpy ride as we, as we brought them together. But ultimately, we, we did, we, you know, we started out in some cases with four small cap equity teams. And, and in, in some instances we selected one and not the others. And others, we instances we might have combined teams. And in other instances, we started all over. So it was a, you know, a multi-year project to, to really bring all of what were the acquired asset managers into one integrated ING investment management. And ultimately, I, I was the CFO of that initially. And then later the COO, the CEO at the time came to me and said, you did a terrific job on the integration project. You can be cce, CFO or COO, which one do you choose? And I said, well, can I be both? And, and he said, no, I can\u2019t do that right now, so you have to pick one. And, and I chose CFO and my rationale was the CF o\u2019s always at the head table because there\u2019s always a financial implication to everything you do. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s where I started. But ultimately did become COO as well, 00:11:12  Eventually, ING changes its name to Voya and everything is now branded Voya that were either these other pieces or ING and you rise to the role of CEO. How did that come about and what was it like going from COO and CFO to CEO? 00:11:32  Yeah, it, it happened because of another crisis In 2008, the, the great financial crisis ING had had gotten overexposed in, in, in mortgages and had to take a loan from the Dutch state to shore up their tier one capital ratios. And as part of that deal with the Dutch government, ING agreed to sell off the US properties. If you can re remember back to the start of the financial crisis, it was viewed as largely a US issue. And so I think there was a desire to, to shed the businesses that, you know, where the, where the subprime mortgage bubble had had burst ultimately. And so I was, I was, you know, working for the head of ING investment management, but when ING decided to take this loan, there was a change in leadership. And, and my boss became head of ING Americas all of the insurance, retirement, and life businesses. 00:12:26 And I became CEO of ING investment management, which later became Voya. The way I found out that I was becoming CEO of I-N-G-I-M was a, was a bit of an interesting story. I was coaching my son at a U 12 hockey tournament up in the northeast, and my cell phone kept ringing while I was on the bench yelling at kids to skate harder and get into the, get into the corners, and it kept ringing. And it was my boss, and it was a Sunday, and eventually in between periods, I picked it up and, and, and it was, my boss at the time was a gentleman named Rob Leary, terrific mentor of mine who said, I, I need you to get down to my house tonight. I said, Rob, I\u2019m up in the Boston area. He lived in Greenwich, Connecticut. And he said, no, you, you have to be here. 00:13:15 And I said, am I fired? And \u2019cause if so, I\u2019m not coming down, just tell me now I\u2019m gonna finish the game. And he said, no, you\u2019re not fired, but you have to get down here. So I made my way down to Greenwich, Connecticut, and I proceeded to learn that ING had taken the loan from the Dutch state, and that in the morning before we woke up, because Europe\u2019s ahead, it was going to go public and my boss would become the CEO of the Americas, and I would become the CEO of the investment management firm. And we, we planned what was gonna happen the next morning. I was gonna have to assure our investment teams, our clients, our, our pension consulting partners, that everything was gonna be okay, and, and that we were, you know, we were still in business, but as you can imagine, it\u2019s incredibly hard to run an asset manager with a for sale sign on, on your back because ING had announced that it would dispose of the US businesses. So another crisis br opportunity for me, I had to actually tell my team of peers that I was now their boss because it was so chaotic that no one came in to actually deliver that message. I had to deliver it myself. But it was a great team and we, we, we rallied together and we, we built the business, grew, grew it coming out of the financial crisis, and then that ultimately became the business that we spun out as Voya. 00:14:37  So, two questions that I, first, I have to get the date of this, like, was this right in the middle of the crisis? Was it towards the tail end? When did you get this Sunday hockey phone call? 00:14:50  Yeah, it was about the middle of 2009. So 2008, you know, as you remember, Barry fourth quarter was chaotic. Sure. We were having global calls trying to preserve capital, who knew what was failing next. And then as we got into 2009, companies were starting to sort out, you know, where they were. And that\u2019s, and it was about mid 2009 where ING decided to take, take the state aid. 00:15:13  But, but the second question is, he couldn\u2019t have told you that over the phone. Like, I know they want everybody in the room when you\u2019re planning, but no, no, this is good news. You\u2019re getting a promotion, get down here. It\u2019s important. Had had a, that\u2019s a stressful drive from Boston to Greenwich. It, 00:15:29  It, it was, I think he was being extra cautious given it that it was material non-public information and, and pretty significant information Gotcha. At, at that. And, and also we needed to be up and running in New York Monday morning and, and so he needed to make sure I was down Sunday night. Gotcha. 00:15:46  That, that\u2019s really, that\u2019s really quite fascinating. How did you end up going from Voya to Jenison Associates? What drew you there? Yeah, 00:15:55  I wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for a new role. I was enjoying enjoying the role at Voya, being CEO of the asset manager. I was on the executive committee. I was learning new skills, being part of quarterly earnings calls and, and, and, you know, helping grow that business as part of a new company and new brand. But at the same time, I was probably deep down ready for a change. I had been with the company for 20 years, but really it had changed around me from Altus to Aetna to, to ING and, and then Voya. And so I was ready for a change. I, I said that to myself that if I left, it would not be for another insurance or bank owned asset manager. And no disrespect to those, those businesses, I had terrific experiences and opportunities presented to me there, but I just felt that, you know, a a a new experience, maybe going back to something more independent or private would, would be the, would be the move for me. 00:16:57 But I got the call and from a recruiter, and Jenison was an intriguing company to me. It\u2019s, you know, just well-known quality firm, strong results, impressive client roster. And I\u2019d heard it had a great culture. So I, I was intrigued and, and, and agreed to have, have some meetings and, and really, really got quite interested in, in, in the business. I thought the people were, were outstanding that I met. They, they validated the culture, the client list and roster truly was impressive. What, you know, what I had to get my head around is that it, it was owned by an insurance company, however, part of p GM\u2019s multi boutique model, and that was, that was very appealing to me. I think for this stage of the asset management industry, a multi boutique model is a, is a good model. You get the asset class specialization, you get the entrepreneurialism in the boutique, but you get the benefit of being part of a larger manager that has access to wealth management platforms, capital, global distribution. So it, it seemed like a very good business model that that allowed for sort of the best of both worlds and, and, you know, I was therefore attracted to it and, and really have not regretted the move one bit. 00:18:19  Hmm. Really interesting. Talk a little bit about Jenison. You mentioned they had been around a while, 1969, they\u2019ve been around for, let\u2019s call it 50 plus almost 60 years. What sort of traditions and cultures made that longevity so attractive to you? 00:18:39  Yeah, it, it was, it was all around reputation and, and the history is that, that Jenison founded in 1969 was really one of the first independent institutional asset managers in those days. All the institutional asset management was done out of the banks. And there were seven founders who decided that maybe they could do it better. And they, they left their banks and they set up a business in the, in the Drake hotel in, in New York City. And they started to, they started to invest. They, they ultimately were growth investors, but growth investing was not even known at the time. You know, the Russell 1000 growth didn\u2019t even exist, but the team started investing in what they believed to be the fastest growing companies, the disruptors of the time, and really became, therefore one of the earliest true growth investors and the founder that, that, that survived the, the, you know, almost the entirety of, of the business and, and was there when I arrived was Sig Sal, who was an iconic investor, again, really one of the first dedicated growth investors. 00:19:43 He was an incredible investor, but also an incredible man. He worked right up until he passed two years ago at 89 Wow. Liter, literally until the week before. He was never going to retire. He, you know, he, he was someone who who taught me a lot. He taught the firm a lot, but at the end of the day, he was an, an intense competitor who wanted to win, but he was very values based. Everything was about the client and, and about values. And he had a great saying, which was do what\u2019s right for clients and that\u2019ll always be right for the business. And I think those are pretty, pretty sage words. And if, if you\u2019re serving your clients well, you\u2019re gonna both retain and, and get, get new clients. And in, and in fact, if you look at our, you know, our client roster, two thirds of our clients have been with us for more than 10 years and 40% more than 20 years. Wow. 00:20:35  That, that\u2019s pretty substantial. I\u2019m kind of intrigued by the concept, and I, I mean, I was a kid in 1969, I think I was seven or eight years old, but the idea that growth investing was like a novel concept. I get the, the idea that, hey, this was kind of the early days of a bear market that that went on for another decade. But tell us, what does it mean to be growth oriented investors when there\u2019s no such thing as a typical growth index or a value index? 00:21:13  You know, what growth investing has meant for Jenison, and it is, it is the original legacy and, and original book of business for the firm we\u2019ve extended from there. But growth investing for us has really been about high conviction, deep fundamental research driven, active manage management. And you know, we\u2019re a, we\u2019re a concentrated manager. We take, we take large positions in, in, in concentrated portfolios, and we\u2019re really striving to be that high alpha equity manager for, for pension plans and for wealth allocators. And often we\u2019re part of an asset allocation and, you know, we\u2019re, you know, we\u2019re the alpha in the corners, if you will. And, you know, I think that\u2019s the right place to play as a fundamental active equity manager because the hollow\u2019s been middled because the middle has been hollowed out. And, you know, at the end of the day, no, no one\u2019s gonna pay active management fees for two to three tracking error equity. 00:22:10  Huh, that makes a lot of sense. So I, I gotta ask two questions about concentration and deep conviction. First, what is a concentrated portfolio? I, I\u2019ve seen a lot of people describe themselves as concentrated portfolios and their 50, 60, a hundred holdings. It doesn\u2019t really seem concentrated. What does concentrated mean to you? 00:22:32  Yeah, for us, 50 60 would be the largest portfolios that, that we manage in our, in our growth book of business. We do have down in our small cap and SMID cap of book of business. We do have larger holdings down there just to get some more liquidity and diversification. But for our, our core franchise of, of growth portfolios, you know, we have 10 stock portfolios, we have 20 stock portfolios. When we say something\u2019s focused, it tends to be about 30. And, and for us, you know, flagship might be up to 50, but not, not typically more than that. 00:23:07  And so when you say deep conviction, what does deep conviction mean? Is that what leads to these 10 stock or 20 stock concentrated portfolios? Tell us a little bit of what does deep conviction mean? 00:23:20  Well, I think it starts with our, our investment research. You know, we\u2019re a firm of 400 people, 70 investment professionals, about half PMs and half analysts. They have very long tenures with, with the firm, about 30 years of experience in the industry, more than 15 on average with the firm. And, you know, they are doing very deep research by teams. So every team, our, our large cap growth team, our global growth team, our small SMID mid team, our value team and our fixed income team all have dedicated research analysts. So there\u2019s no central research model, there\u2019s no house view, there\u2019s no, you know, mandated approach to seeking Alpha. Every team has the, has the ability to seek alpha in its own way. And what we have are very long tenured experienced career analysts. So our analysts and our firm are as important as our portfolio managers. 00:24:18 It\u2019s not necessarily as track to portfolio management. In fact, we believe, you know, the real secret sauce to, to Jenison is the research that, that we do and what the teams do. And on the growth side, at, at the end of the day, what we\u2019re looking for is innovative and disruptive businesses driving structural shifts in industries, you know, business models with, with significant barriers to entry, secular demand trends driven by superior product offerings. And these days, you know, as you know, that might be EVs, autonomous driving, machine learning, obesity, drugs or luxury that\u2019s owned through the value chain. And all of those tend to be superior growers. They tend to have moats around them and, and are the, the leaders and the disruptors. And, and you know, as you know, Barry history has shown that market returns over time have been driven by a narrow set of disruptors and consistent winners. And Jenison has developed a reputation for identifying those companies. 00:25:18  So the past 15 years, those innovators, disruptors, companies with moats have primarily been US based. Right. And we see the rest of the world, Asia, Japan, Europe primarily lagging the us although there seems to be a lot of signs these days that that\u2019s starting to change. Certainly Q1, 2025 Europe is dramatically outperforming the us. How do you think about the relationship between US investing and international investing? I know only about 10 or 15% of your assets are invested overseas. What, what would it take to make that change? 00:26:03  Yeah. In terms of our, our portfolios that are invested overseas, and then I\u2019ll, and then I\u2019ll answer your question about how do I think about international versus US markets. We have a, a about 25 billion of dedicated international and global portfolios. But within our other equity portfolios across the firm, we do hold a percentage of international assets. So that, that number ultimately is about 40 billion of our 150 billion of equity. So it is a, a little larger than it, than it may, may appear. Gotcha. And you know, at the end of the day, un unless we have investment guidelines or restrictions from clients, you know, we seek alpha with a bit of ag agnosticism to both the benchmark and the region. So we are building portfolios, bottoms up, company by company and looking for what we, you know, view are the best companies for our strategy, whether that be intrinsic value. 00:26:57 And, you know, what we think are, are undervalued companies or the disruptors and, and the growers in terms of international holdings, per se, as you mentioned, the, the first quarter after a long drought of underperformance compared to the US international equities have had a, had a nice run. You know, it\u2019s primarily driven by policy shifts locally in some of those regions as well as reactions to current US policy shifts and the uncertainty around that. So in Asia, you know, the, the government is clearly priming the pump in, in Europe, increased defense spending has, has really ignited, ignited the, the markets over there. And so I think the international markets might have some legs. We do still favor the us you know, in in the medium term and, and longer term right now. But, but certainly international markets after being beaten down for, for years have have come back strongly. 00:27:56  So let\u2019s talk a little bit about risk management. I know you guys employ the traditional sector, diversification, geographic diversification, different strategies. But talk a little bit about your risk management and the downside protection you deploy to make sure that volatility like we\u2019ve been seeing doesn\u2019t hit the bottom line too hard. 00:28:19  Yeah, and, and you know, as we discussed Barry, we, we are concentrated managers, high conviction managers, so, you know, we\u2019re paid to take risk and as a result, our portfolios do tend to be more volatile than the benchmarks certainly, and, and many other managers who are more diversified. So, you know, we will have periods where we wildly outperform the benchmark and periods where we underperform the benchmark, we\u2019re looking typically at a holding period in our names of, you know, three to five years and much longer. And so, you know, we are long-term investors. We, we wanna align interests with our clients who are long-term investors and try to filter out the quarter to quarter noise and the volatility that that comes in, in between those periods. So again, if we can identify those companies early that are gonna be the longer term winners, that\u2019s, that\u2019s where we go from a risk perspective. What we want to protect against is unintended risk. So we are taking very deliberate and, and concentrated risk, but we have every kind of risk management report that you would expect in an asset manager to make sure we don\u2019t have unintended risks to check our dispersion and to make sure that at the end of the day, the risks we\u2019re taking our stock selection risk and not unintended risk around, you know, size, geography, sector. 00:29:41  So I don\u2019t usually hear the phrase unintended risk. So I, I certainly understand the risk of performance relative to a benchmark. You\u2019re gonna over underperform, you\u2019re gonna outperform. What are some other unintended risks? Is it strictly just sector concentration, a geographic concentration, or is there a little more nuance to it? 00:30:03  We wanna make sure at the, at the end of the day that the risk we\u2019re taking is, is stock specific. That\u2019s, that\u2019s who we are on the equity side. We are, we are stock pickers. And so we wanna make sure that, you know, what\u2019s, what\u2019s coming through our portfolio from a risk perspective is all based on stock selection and not some of the more factor based influences that can, that can take shape in portfolios. And as you mentioned, you know, sector and geography and, and, and other exposures. Hmm. 00:30:34  Really interesting. So, so given that PGIM is the parent company and they run a a, a sort of multi boutique, multi-strategy approach, how does your concentrated alpha approach to investing fit in are, do you have to think about, well maybe this group or that group is doing something sep similar or do you do your thing and it\u2019s up to the parent company to select the allocation they want? 00:31:04  Yeah, the great thing about the multi-manager model at PG Im is each of the affiliates, as we call them versus boutiques, are free to, to pursue their asset class and their specialty in their own way. Now, to the extent that there are multi-asset portfolios put together, you know, within PGIM that might select components of the different affiliates or boutiques, you know, that\u2019ll be determined by the multi-asset team doing the asset allocation. You know, for, for Jenison given, you know, the high highly concentrated, you know, nature of our, of our equity portfolios, we fit into some of those multi-asset products, but in other cases we don\u2019t. We\u2019re too high octane for that. But we are in a number of annuity and, and other asset allocation products throughout Prudential that, that avail themselves of, of our various capabilities. And the other thing that, that, that Jenison can do is we have a small quantitative equity team, not to be confused with PGIM quantitative services, which is a, a sister company. 00:32:13 Our team is there to customize our fundamental alpha from our equity portfolios. So if a client is looking for a targeted tracking error, a targeted volatility, you know, likes what we do, but maybe can\u2019t quite, you know, take, take the tracking error of volatility, we can manipulate the portfolio to fit within their requirements. They might be someone who wants a sustainable portfolio and, and, you know, has some exclusions or types of industries they, they don\u2019t want to include. So having this little quant group within Jenison to customize our, our outcomes for our clients has, has been a, a, a terrific addition of value that has allowed us to get into some of these multi-asset products. The other great thing about the the PGM multi-manager model that I\u2019ll comment on is that we have virtually no overlap among the different affiliates or boutiques. So Jenison is the, is the fundamental active equity manager, you know, PGM quantitative services is the quant manager, PGM fixed income has, you know, broad based fixed income capabilities. We have private real estate, private credit, et cetera. And we\u2019re not fighting with each other over shelf space in different products because we\u2019re all experts in, in what we do 00:33:29  Now, it\u2019s taken me about 10 years to stop saying Prudential and start saying p Im, you did mention Prudential. When you think about the parent company, it traces back to Prudential Insurance, which is still a giant brand. How does the relationship between Genesis, how does the relationship between Gene and p IM and PE Prudential just affect the nomenclature? It\u2019s a lot of stuff to keep, keep straight. 00:33:58  It is, you have, you have the master brand of Prudential 150 years. You have the PE GM brand of a little over a decade old, and then you have the brands underneath Jenison at, at 55 years being the oldest of, of, of the investment management brands. It\u2019s also why Jenison tends to be the most independent of the, of the affiliates or boutiques. It was an acquired business, about 75% of the assets were sourced by Jenison versus assets that, that have come through some of the Prudential or or PGM channels. But, you know, we do, you know, we do have to be careful about the branding and sometimes it\u2019s at the product level. For example, PGM runs a lot of the, you know, the, the consolidated platforms like the, the mutual fund platform. And in Europe, the, the, the USIP platform that, that are, you know, used to, to structure the funds that are sold into the wealth management channels. And there, for example, if you wanna buy Jenison in a growth fund through the, through the PGM mutual fund company, it\u2019s the PGM Jenison Growth Fund. Huh. So sometimes we have multiple brands at play. 00:35:13  Huh, really interesting. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about the current environment. It certainly has been a chaotic first quarter with tariffs on and off. Again, you guys are deep fundamental investors. How do you think about news flow and all this noisy stuff? When you\u2019re looking at the fundamentals of companies? 00:35:39  It\u2019s, it\u2019s hard to do, but it, it really comes down to, to focus. At the end of the day, we have to try to filter out the noise. Now we can\u2019t, we\u2019re we\u2019re not macro investors, but we have to be macro aware. We have to understand if policy shifts or, you know, anything in the macro environment will ultimately affect the environment in which our companies operate. So we, we always bring it back to the fundamentals. You know, we can\u2019t put blinders on and say this is a great company, but if, if the landscape in which they operate changes, it can affect the fundamentals of the company. So, you know, we work very hard to try to separate the, you know, the noise from the fundamentals. But at the end of the day, sometimes that that macro environment can affect the fundamentals. 00:36:24  So when it starts affecting the fundamentals, how, how do you manage it? I\u2019m assuming since you\u2019re the alpha managers, you don\u2019t have an option of saying, we are gonna go to cash or we\u2019re gonna go to bonds. Is it a matter of saying, Hey, Europe seems to be doing better, we\u2019re gonna rotate shift some of our exposure from the US to overseas? How, how do you deal with the macro once it starts affecting the fundamentals? 00:36:50  Yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s exactly as, as, as you described, we\u2019re, we\u2019re paid to invest in a certain strategy for a client. So we, we hold very little cash just, just for liquidity and trading. We\u2019re, we\u2019re paid to be fully invested. And so, you know, as we see either a sector or a supply chain or a company\u2019s fundamentals coming under pressure will, will either underweight or, or get out of the, the company completely and look for the next best opportunity. 00:37:16  Really kind of interesting. You had a piece recently at Jenison titled is Value Investing Debt. Tell us a little bit about that. 00:37:26  Yeah, well, well, growth index indexes have, have certainly outperformed value for, for well over a decade. I think we\u2019re all aware of that. That\u2019s, that\u2019s been good for Jenison. Two thirds of our equity assets are, are growth oriented assets and, and we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve benefited during this period and also outperformed and, and, and raised money in new clients. So, you know, a lot of that has been, has been a great tailwind for our business. But we also have a, a high performing value team that\u2019s, that\u2019s put up some very good numbers. The way we, the way we manage in, in value is, is called an intrinsic value approach, which is very opportunistic. It\u2019s not deep value or a fallen angel type strategy. We look for companies with temporarily depressed earnings versus a permanent situation. We try to identify those and periods of short-term volatility can actually favor our approach if we can, if we can decipher, you know, which companies have hit an inflection point and get into those early and hold them long term. Now the market has broadened out recently from the Mag seven and some of the, you know, the, the most concentrated positions that have, that have led the market and, and we\u2019re being rewarded, you know, for executing in, in the value space. There\u2019s still good companies and good growth in value. I don\u2019t think investors really think about growth versus value investing like they used to. I think they think about it as portions of the portfolio stable growers maybe with dividends versus innovators and disruptors that, that might lead the way in the future. 00:39:03  Huh. That\u2019s really, that\u2019s really kind of interesting. It, it\u2019s funny because you, you were talking about your approach to intrinsic value and I would imagine that as the Mag seven and traditional growth equity falters, the volatility of this market would be great for an opportunistic intrinsic value investor. Tell us how the value guys are salivating these days over, over what the state of markets are with volatility spiking up close to 30. 00:39:40  Yeah, I think volatility actually can be good on the growth side as well. So I think, oh really, I think when you\u2019re a a fundamental stock picker, you, you want number one as, as little correlation as possible. If everything goes up, it\u2019s hard to differentiate yourself when markets broaden out. You know, when, when volatility is, is, is elevated, you know, it really, you really have to have skill to, to differentiate and to separate the noise, you know, from the fundamentals of the company. And so we think we can benefit in these periods both on the, the value and the growth side. Certainly, you know, on the growth side has pulled back most recently in, in the first quarter, you\u2019re, you\u2019re starting to see that shift back already. It appears that mid-March was perhaps the, you know, the, the, you know, the bottom and we seem to be, you know, starting to bounce off of that. I, I for one, don\u2019t, don\u2019t see a recession on the horizon at at least not a, not a severe one. So I think we will continue to see as, as you know, we filter through the noise, we learn that tariffs may be a little more targeted and forgiven in some instances that the supply chains don\u2019t get as disrupted as, as we thought. And we could see a, a good period for, for growth equity again. 00:41:05  So you have large cap growth equity as a focus, you have global equity opportunity. What are some of the other areas where, where you guys focus in terms of looking for alpha? 00:41:19  Yeah, growth, growth equity as, as we\u2019ve talked about was the foundation of the firm and, and the largest book of assets about half the assets of the firm. We have a, a global growth team that, that was built and extended off of that getting into global international and emerging market equity. Also following a a growth style and and philosophy. That team leverages a lot of the same research of our growth analysts. Then we have a, a small smid mid cap team. They\u2019re a little more val growth managers, but a little more valuation sensitive there. And we offer that in, in sort of growth and core portfolios. Our value team, we talked about our intrinsic value capabilities, but you know, on the value side, we, we also have certain sector funds, infrastructure, utilities, energy and, and other things. And, and including some of some strategies that are in demand in Europe, like carbon solution strategy. 00:42:23 That\u2019s a sort of a brown to green strategy, if you will. And then we have our $50 billion fixed income shop based up in Boston. They are really the antithesis of what we do in, in, in high conviction focused, concentrated equity. They are a high, high quality credit shop staying in, in, you know, the higher end of the space there, down the fairway core fixed income manager managing for the largest pension plans in in the world and also in stable value and LDI mandates. So it\u2019s also a nice diversifier for the business. We have this very stable, you know, core credit manager and this high conviction, high alpha equity manager. 00:43:11  So given that there seems to be a consensus at your shop of higher for longer, at least when it comes to rates, since you brought up fixed income and you brought up credit, does this allow your clients to say, Hey, we could take a little off the table with equity and focus a little more on, on stable fixed income. How, how, how does that balance work? 00:43:34  Yeah, we\u2019ve seen that over the last several years as, as, as rates ticked up and there was something to earn in fixed income. Again, we, we watch pension plans, you know, adjust their, their asset allocations. You know, one of the double-edged swords of of of being a high performing equity manager is when the equity markets run up and you outperform the benchmark you get allocated against, you\u2019re the one they take the money away from. So, you know, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve had that happen and, and have been a victim of our success, if you will, in some of these areas. So we have seen that over the last couple of years as rates ticked up where we did see some of our clients, you know, maintain us, but but shift some of 00:44:14  That to sort of rebalance, rebalance from alpha generating concentrated equity into more stable, lower yielding fixed income. 00:44:23  Exactly. Exactly. I mean, we, we do, you know, I\u2019m not one to, to call rates per se, but you know, I I I agree with the base case out there that we\u2019ll probably see two cuts, hopefully they\u2019re, you know, they\u2019re for the right reasons and not bad news cuts, if you will. 00:44:39  So, so that\u2019s interesting you say that because originally last year, wall Street was looking for a lot more cuts than we got and the, the sort of pushback to the expectation was, hey, the economy\u2019s really robust, consumers are spending, companies are hiring CapEx, spending is up, revenue and profits are up. What, why are you guys expecting cuts? How does that transition now where, you know, I\u2019m in your camp, I don\u2019t really see an imminent recession, but at the same time it, it certainly appears that recession risks are ticking up. They\u2019re still relatively low, but they\u2019re appreciably higher than they were at the end of, of 2024. So if we\u2019re gonna get two cuts, is that because the Fed wants to normalize rates to where they\u2019ve been over the past 20, 25 years as as inflation sort of settles down? Or are we gonna see cuts because the economy is beginning to slow? 00:45:42  Yeah, I, I agree with you completely. I, I, I hope it\u2019s the former and, and, and not the latter. We are starting to see some signs of some potential slowing of growth. I do think we could see growth slow down from what it\u2019s been, but, 00:45:56  And it\u2019s been red hot and it\u2019s been for a good 00:45:58  Couple of years and it\u2019s been red hot. You know, there\u2019s still some good signs out there. Housing starts are up, services, PMI is up, you know, retail sales and manufacturing are down, consumer sentiment\u2019s down the income and labor markets importantly are still, are still decent. I think that\u2019ll be a major determinant of, of where we go. Inflation is stubborn, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s showing signs of coming down in key areas, tariffs not withstanding. And, you know, I think the tariff path will, will determine a lot of where we go here. 00:46:29  So it, it sounds like you guys stick to your knitting, you do fundamental research, you focus on intrinsic value, but you\u2019re certainly aware that hey, what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world, it could have an impact and bleed over. If you are advising pension funds or foundations that have a perpetual lifespan, or at least future liabilities that are decades off, is the best advice, Hey, it\u2019s gonna get bumpy for a while, but you have to look past this, look to the other side of whatever happens over the next 1, 2, 4 years. Or is it everybody man, their battle stations? 00:47:10  Yeah, I, I I think keeping a long-term focus is good advice, you know, for, for the pension plans who obviously have teams of experts, you know, focused on their asset allocation, but also for the retail investor who, who obviously has the financial advisor as well. But you know, as you know, Barry, staying invested is key. When people try to time the markets and, and exit, you know, they, they\u2019ve, they\u2019ve always regretted that, you know, being in the market during those key points of inflection when, when markets tick up or missing that that last, that last large spike, you know, really can have a, a dramatically negative impact on your returns overall. 00:47:55  Yeah, we, we\u2019ve seen a lot of studies that show the worst days and the best days tend to come clustered together and it\u2019s very hard to miss one and, and catch the other. 00:48:04  Absolutely. 00:48:04  So I know I only have you for a, a limited amount of time. Let\u2019s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests. Starting with what\u2019s keeping you entertained these days? What are you either watching or listening to? What, what\u2019s your, tell us about your favorite podcast, Netflix, whatever, 00:48:25  You know, I\u2019m always well behind where, where everyone else is. I didn\u2019t watch the first episode of The Sopranos until, until the series was over. Oh 00:48:33  Really? 00:48:34  And I\u2019m just starting Yellowstone. So that, that tells you how, how up to date 00:48:39  I, you\u2019re ahead of me in Yellowstone. It\u2019s the next one up in my queue. Are you enjoying it? 00:48:45  I just started it so, so far so good. I\u2019ve heard so many great things about it. So I\u2019m, I\u2019m looking forward to it. I\u2019m, I\u2019m a bit of a history buff, so I\u2019ve been working my way through the Ken Burns documentaries. I\u2019ve seen the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, the Civil War, the Vietnam War, and the Great War. And the next one up for me is Benjamin Franklin. So I really enjoy Ken Burns and, and how he approaches, you know, the the documentary, 00:49:13  Huh. Really interesting. You, you mentioned one of your mentors previously. Tell us about the folks who helped shape your career. Who, who were your mentors? 00:49:24  Yeah, I would say first, you know, it, it, it, it was my mother from a, a values and from a work ethic perspective, first generation college grad, went to, got a master\u2019s at Georgetown, worked in politics, ran some nonprofits, and then ultimately worked in, in in education. She\u2019s, she\u2019s 90 years old and, and still alive and, and doing well. And, and you know, she\u2019s been a great inspiration to me. Again, from a, from a values and and work ethic perspective. I\u2019ve also had the, the, the great opportunity to, to work for some great leaders and, and managers. I tried to learn from each one of them along the way, take the, the, the styles or the characteristics that I most admired of each of them and try to incorporate that into my leadership style. At, at, at Altas, it was John Kim and Scott Fox at, at, you know, Bob Crispin, Rob Leary at at ING and then Alon, Kara Lin at, at Voya to name a few Sig Segal, who, who I mentioned past about two years ago. 00:50:26 I worked with him, him for only about six years. And while, you know, he wasn\u2019t necessarily a mentor in the sense of helping me do my job, which was terrific. When, when, when I came on board, SIG said, I I manage the money, you manage the firm. And he, he kept his word there and allowed me to do what, what, you know, we felt we needed to do to help grow the business and set the strategy. And it was a, it was a terrific partnership and, and I have great admiration for him. So he was more an inspiration to me, just the, you know, his will to win and, and the way he impacted everyone around him and the quality and the values of the firm that he built. Really inspirational. Hmm. 00:51:06  Real, really interesting. Let\u2019s talk about books. What are you reading currently? What are some of your favorites? 00:51:13  Yeah, right, right now I just started leadership in Turbulent Times from, from Doris Kearns Goodwin. It seems a little apropos Sure. Right now. And, and you know, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a book about Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR and, and LBJ. And it kind of, you know, takes you through their, you know, their administrations and, and some of the, the challenges that they faced. You know, it\u2019s a big book. It, it\u2019s sat on my coffee table for a few years and I looked at it and I, you know, I\u2019ve wanted to kind of tap in, but it was four inches high. And, and finally, I, I did tap in and I\u2019m glad I did. 00:51:51  Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either investment, credit, finance, anything along the lines of, of your career experiences? 00:52:07  Yeah, I, I would say first thing you know, you know, getting into finance, the path to finance starts so much earlier than it ever did. And, and in our day, you know, it was senior year, it was time to look for a job. Maybe you had an internship, you know, the year before, but now undergrads going into finance, they need to be lining up their internships sophomore summer, junior summer, senior summer. So, so it really starts a lot sooner. But once they\u2019re on the job, my, my advice to them is always build a, a resume of skills, not a resume of jobs. Try to, you know, try to develop as many skills as you can along the way and ask questions early and often. You\u2019re not expected to know anything when, when you\u2019re young and in the job, but as, as you move on in your career, you\u2019re expected to know more and it becomes a little harder to, to ask questions and then ask for experiences outside of your current duties. 00:53:04 So if you see something going on in the, in the next department over, ask if you can be exposed to that, you know, while doing your, the job you were hired for and, and try to get more, more exposure. But don\u2019t expect anything to be given to you. You own your career, seek out mentors and, and try to learn, but at the end of the day, you, you have to take ownership of your career and your advancement will really depend on the success of your current role. And if you focus on that and, and do it well, you\u2019ll be recognized. 00:53:36  Hmm. Really good, good advice. And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 30, 40 years ago when you were first getting started? 00:53:47  Well, as I mentioned, I didn\u2019t know anything about it 40 years ago when I was getting started coming outta college. But, but in reflecting back, what I, what I think would be helpful would\u2019ve been how many different types of finance careers there actually are. Everyone thinks sort of Wall Street investment banking m and a, but, but there\u2019s investment management, there\u2019s wealth management, there\u2019s insurance, there\u2019s commercial banking, there\u2019s, you know, there\u2019s institutional banking, so many, many careers in in finance in past that, that, that you can go down. I had a very narrow view of, of, of the investment world. And, you know, my journey really, you know, happened because of the next role that I got and the next role that I got. I didn\u2019t have a plan per se. And I think, you know, I wish I knew more earlier on and I might have set a plan. The plan turned out okay and, and I\u2019ve been happy with it. But you know, who knows what the path would\u2019ve taken had I known a little more about it. Huh. 00:54:45  Really interesting stuff. Jeff, thank you for being so generous with your time.

{"text": "ByChrister Holloman ByChrister Holloman, Contributor. Banks used to wait for customers to come to them\u2014now they meet customers where they are by embedding ... More their services into everyday platforms. In an era of digital disruption and shifting consumer expectations, banks are under mounting pressure to stay relevant. One of the most transformative, and perhaps under appreciated, strategies banks are now embracing is embedded finance. From enabling seamless lending at the point of sale to powering B2B payment flows within third-party platforms, embedded finance is no longer a fringe innovation. It\u2019s becoming a core part of how banks compete in a fast-changing financial ecosystem. According to a recent article published by The World Economic Forum, embedded finance is a disruptive force financial institutions can\u2019t ignore. Embedded finance refers to the integration of financial services such as lending, payments, insurance, or even investing directly into non-financial platforms. Think of the ability to buy insurance while checking out on an e-commerce site or to get a small business loan while using accounting software. It allows financial products to be delivered in-context, at the point of need, creating a seamless customer experience. For banks, this shift marks a departure from the traditional model of expecting customers to come to them. Instead, banks are going to where their customers already are: digital platforms. Several forces are converging to make embedded finance a strategic imperative for banks: Changing Consumer Behavior: Customers increasingly expect financial services to be instant, contextual, and invisible. They don\u2019t want to toggle between platforms to complete a transaction. Platform Dominance: From Shopify to Salesforce, platforms are becoming the digital infrastructure of the economy. The financial services offered within these ecosystems have a natural advantage. Fintech Disruption: Fintechs have been quick to capitalize on embedded opportunities. Companies like Stripe, Square, and Adyen are offering banking-like services without being banks. Regulatory Modernization: In markets like the U.S., UK, and Europe, open banking and evolving licensing regimes make it easier for banks to offer services via APIs and partnerships. Banks have long viewed technology as a risk. Embedded finance reframes it as a growth opportunity. Globally, the embedded finance market is expected to reach $7 trillion in size by 2030, according to a report by Dealroom and ABN AMRO Ventures. This is not just about adding distribution channels. It's about monetizing the bank's core competencies\u2014credit, trust, compliance, and risk management\u2014in new environments. Here are three compelling reasons banks are leaning in: New Distribution Channels: By embedding their services into digital platforms, banks can reach more customers without opening new branches or launching expensive marketing campaigns. Data Advantage: Embedded finance offers real-time access to user behavior, transaction histories, and contextual insights that traditional banking relationships often miss. Partnership Leverage: Rather than compete with fintechs, many banks are now choosing to partner with them. Embedded finance allows for modular collaboration where each party plays to its strengths. Goldman Sachs + Apple: Goldman\u2019s partnership with Apple for the Apple Card and Apple Savings is a prime example of a bank embedding its financial products into a consumer tech ecosystem. BBVA + Solaris: BBVA has partnered with embedded finance infrastructure firm Solaris to deliver banking services-as-a-service across Europe. JP Morgan + Gusto: JP Morgan has collaborated with Gusto, a payroll and HR platform, to embed small business banking and payments capabilities. These are not tech experiments. They are serious, revenue-generating strategies with long-term implications. Banks that fail to embrace embedded finance risk becoming invisible\u2014not because their services are irrelevant, but because their distribution is. Consumers and businesses increasingly expect financial services to be built in, not bolted on. Banks that cling to legacy distribution models may see their brand recognition diminish, even as demand for their core services remains strong. For banks looking to launch or scale embedded finance initiatives, here are three actionable steps: Choose Your Use Case: Start with a single high-impact vertical\u2014like small business lending, payroll integrations, or B2B payments\u2014rather than trying to do it all at once. Build or Partner for Infrastructure: Decide whether to build in-house APIs and onboarding tools or to partner with an embedded finance enabler . Create a Cross-Functional Team: Embedded finance spans product, compliance, legal, tech, and partnership functions. Success depends on coordinated execution across the organization. Embedded finance isn\u2019t just a new channel. It\u2019s a new way of thinking about how and where banking happens. It pushes banks to become infrastructure providers, not just service providers. This is a profound shift in identity\u2014but also a liberating one. Banks don\u2019t need to own the end-user relationship to own value creation. Just as cloud providers enable software companies behind the scenes, banks can become the trusted rails behind the next generation of commerce, work, and digital life. As financial services become more decentralized, banks that embrace embedded finance will position themselves not just to survive, but to lead. The future of banking isn\u2019t a place. It\u2019s a presence\u2014seamless, context-aware, and invisible. Embedded finance is how banks make that presence felt. For those that act decisively, this is more than a technological shift. It\u2019s a strategic inflection point. Now is the time for banks to ask: Are we ready to be everywhere our customers need us to be?

{"text": "Apple will report its earnings results for the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year on Thursday, May 1 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts a half hour later. Keep reading for some key things to know about the quarter, including a recap of new products announced, revenue expectations, and more. The quarter ran from December 29, 2024 through March 29, 2025, according to Apple's fiscal calendar. The following products launched during this period: Apple has not provided formal revenue guidance since before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the average Wall Street estimate for Apple's second quarter revenue is $94.1 billion, according to data compiled by Yahoo Finance. This would be around a 3.5% increase over the $90.8 billion revenue the company reported in the year-ago quarter. This would be in line with the outlook that Parekh provided on last quarter's earnings call:  we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year. Cook and Parekh will hold a conference call on May 1 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the company's quarterly earnings results. The call should last around one hour, and it will include a Q&A segment with analysts. A live audio stream of the conference call will be available on Apple's Investor Relations page, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay. Investors will be listening for any commentary that Cook and Parekh may provide about tariffs. Apple's current quarter runs from March 30 through June 28, and the company has yet to announce any new products during this period. U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced that the U.S. will be imposing steep tariffs on products imported from China and many other countries, starting April 9. Apple will be impacted by this decision, as it still assembles the majority of iPhones in China, despite pushing to expand production in countries like India. China will be subject to a 54% tariff, and Trump has threatened the country with additional tariffs. Apple could increase prices due to the tariffs, but the company may find creative ways to offset the added costs. The tariffs could provide a boost to Apple's third quarter revenue, as some customers are reportedly panic-buying iPhones ahead of potential price increases. However, the fourth quarter could be tougher than usual for Apple. Apple shares are trading at around $184 as of writing, down from a 52-week high of $260.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It\u2019s time to take a hard look at your own finances \u2014 and theirs. by Jonquilyn Hill Money is always stressful, but between on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs, inflation, and a general sense of uncertainty, all things finance have been especially anxiety-inducing lately. Much of the advice given is geared toward people who have time to make up losses in the stock market. But what if you\u2019re retired or close to retirement age? That\u2019s the matter at hand on this week\u2019s episode of Explain It to Me, Vox\u2019s call-in podcast where we answer the questions that matter to you most. Washington Post personal finance columnist Michelle Singletary knows that worry firsthand. She\u2019s on the edge baby boomer and Gen X and is looking ahead to when she\u2019s no longer working. \u201cLike many people, I\u2019m stressed to the max,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I am punching a lot of pillows and crying and screaming and doing a little cussing, but trying to not let the fear dictate moves. And that\u2019s the key.\u201d Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. What other advice does she have for people looking to retire soon? And how should those of us who have more time talk with our older loved ones about their retirement plans? Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you\u2019d like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545. What should people who are approaching retirement age be doing right now in this economic moment? You want to do a retirement budget. Figure out what it would take if you retired to live in retirement. And if you have a shortfall, then there are some things that you need to do. Try to boost your savings. Try to look at your housing situation. Can I cut housing? Can I have a roommate? Do I need to move someplace that is more affordable? So you have to do some forward thinking before you retire to make sure that your finances are as secure as possible. I have to admit something: I was particularly interested in this episode because my parents are boomers. What advice do you have for listeners that are like me? It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re concerned about your parents because if they\u2019re not prepared, then that burden may fall on you. I say burden, not in a sense of you don\u2019t want to do it, but certainly when you are in your 30s, 40s, and early 50s, you\u2019re trying to get ready for your own retirement. But I think this is a good opportunity to have open conversations. This is a window to say, \u201cHey, How are you positioned? Are you worried? Is there anything I should be concerned about? Is there something I can do differently to help you?\u201d And maybe that\u2019ll open up a conversation where they say, \u201cNo, we\u2019re fine. We\u2019re really worried, but we got things in control. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d It\u2019s a very difficult conversation to have, especially if you\u2019ve grown up in a household where money wasn\u2019t talked about a lot. For a younger adult to try to come to their parents and say, \u201cHey, you got any money? What\u2019s going on?\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s a hard conversation. But the roles aren\u2019t reversed. You are not their parents. You are now an adult friend who happens to be their child. How do you recommend that listeners start that conversation with the retirement-age folks in their lives? Start with yourself and your own feelings. Say, \u201cI\u2019d love to talk to you about this because I\u2019m a little worried. I\u2019m saving for retirement and this is what\u2019s concerning me.\u201d And then you say, \u201cHow about you?\u201d What you don\u2019t want to do is say something like, \u201cDo you have any money? What\u2019s going on?\u201d You don\u2019t want to come at them in a more adversarial way. You should see each other as companions and accountability partners. What should people prioritize when they look at their finances right now? In this moment, cash is king. If you got a tax refund, I would be saving that. If you were already just getting by \u2014 maybe you weren\u2019t living paycheck to paycheck but there wasn\u2019t much left over \u2014 I would be stockpiling cash in a high-yield savings account in case you lose your job, in case the economy really does go into a recession, if it gets worse than it is now. The prudent thing right now is to not get into any kind of debt or use a lot of cash that you might need if you lose your job. If I was a federal employee, a federal contractor, anybody whose income is derived from the federal government in a significant way, I would be canceling vacations. I would not be doing major home improvement projects. I don\u2019t want to make people panic \u2014 although it\u2019s perfectly fine if you\u2019re scared because that\u2019s just human nature. But I will say the prudent thing right now is to not get into any kind of debt or use a lot of cash that you might need if you lose your job. What are the different ways people can help their parents financially without getting behind on their own goals? Do your own budget, and make sure that you have a cash cushion for yourself. Make sure that you are saving in a way that will hopefully help you have a secure retirement. Get rid of all your debts: If you got credit card debt, student loan, car note \u2014 everything except for your mortgage. Then, if all of that is taken care of, if you want to create an account where you put some money in every month to say, \u201cThis is the money that I\u2019m gonna designate to help my parents or maybe another relative.\u201d My husband and I do that. We have a family and friends fund so that if somebody loses their job or has some difficulty, this is where we pull the money to help them out. What advice do you have for people who are at retirement age but haven\u2019t been able to save as much? How do they prepare for this moment? The first thing I would say is don\u2019t beat yourself up. You are where you are. Accept that, but do something about it. If you are getting close to retirement, then you\u2019ve got to make some hard decisions. Look at your housing situation. You might have to say, \u201cYou know what? Those young adults that were asking me about my money? Maybe I have to move in with them or they move in with me.\u201d And so you look at the big parts of your budget and how you might change that. Financial advice can admittedly be a little frustrating because we hear the same thing over and over again. \u201cSit tight, stay the course, don\u2019t make any rash decisions.\u201d What do you say to people who feel antsy right now? Who want a different answer than what they usually hear? Listen, good advice is good advice, no matter what. Good advice is timeless. And people want a microwave answer to a problem that needs to be baked in the oven. You can\u2019t microwave your way away from this situation. You just can\u2019t. There is no secret recipe or secret anything. We know by history. The market eventually returns historically. Could it change in the future? Sure it can. But we have decades and decades of data that show that when we go into an economic downturn, we come out because it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to make sure that happens. And so while you may be tired of us saying, \u201cHold tight,\u201d you might be tired of us saying, \u201cDon\u2019t make rash decisions,\u201d that is the best advice. We know that when you make decisions in haste, when you make decisions based on your emotions, you make bad decisions. I will not tell you not to panic when the market goes down. I will not tell you that because it is human to be mad and angry and upset and scared. Be all of those. Just don\u2019t make decisions in that moment. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. Astrology\u2019s enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.

{"text": "China-based purveyors of SMS phishing kits are enjoying remarkable success converting phished payment card data into mobile wallets from Apple and Google. Until recently, the so-called \u201cSmishing Triad\u201d mainly impersonated toll road operators and shipping companies. But experts say these groups are now directly targeting customers of international financial institutions, while dramatically expanding their cybercrime infrastructure and support staff. An image of an iPhone device farm shared on Telegram by one of the Smishing Triad members. Image: Prodaft. If you own a mobile device, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years you\u2019ve received at least one instant message that warns of a delinquent toll road fee, or a wayward package from the U.S. Postal Service . Those who click the promoted link are brought to a website that spoofs the USPS or a local toll road operator and asks for payment card information. The site will then complain that the visitor\u2019s bank needs to \u201cverify\u201d the transaction by sending a one-time code via SMS. In reality, the bank is sending that code to the mobile number on file for their customer because the fraudsters have just attempted to enroll that victim\u2019s card details into a mobile wallet. If the visitor supplies that one-time code, their payment card is then added to a new mobile wallet on an Apple or Google device that is physically controlled by the phishers. The phishing gangs typically load multiple stolen cards to digital wallets on a single Apple or Android device, and then sell those phones in bulk to scammers who use them for fraudulent e-commerce and tap-to-pay transactions. A screenshot of the administrative panel for a smishing kit. On the left is the  data entered at the phishing site. On the right we can see the phishing kit has superimposed the supplied card number onto an image of a payment card. When the phishing kit scans that created card image into Apple or Google Pay, it triggers the victim\u2019s bank to send a one-time code. Image: Ford Merrill. The moniker \u201cSmishing Triad\u201d comes from Resecurity, which was among the first to report in August 2023 on the emergence of three distinct mobile phishing groups based in China that appeared to share some infrastructure and innovative phishing techniques. But it is a bit of a misnomer because the phishing lures blasted out by these groups are not SMS or text messages in the conventional sense. Rather, they are sent via iMessage to Apple device users, and via RCS on Google Android devices. Thus, the missives bypass the mobile phone networks entirely and enjoy near 100 percent delivery rate . In a report published on March 24, the Swiss threat intelligence firm Prodaft detailed the rapid pace of innovation coming from the Smishing Triad, which it characterizes as a loosely federated group of Chinese phishing-as-a-service operators with names like Darcula, Lighthouse, and the Xinxin Group. Prodaft said they\u2019re seeing a significant shift in the underground economy, particularly among Chinese-speaking threat actors who have historically operated in the shadows compared to their Russian-speaking counterparts. \u201cChinese-speaking actors are introducing innovative and cost-effective systems, enabling them to target larger user bases with sophisticated services,\u201d Prodaft wrote. \u201cTheir approach marks a new era in underground business practices, emphasizing scalability and efficiency in cybercriminal operations.\u201d A new report from researchers at the security firm SilentPush finds the Smishing Triad members have expanded into selling mobile phishing kits targeting customers of global financial institutions like CitiGroup, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, and Visa, as well as banks in Canada, Latin America, Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region. Phishing lures from the Smishing Triad spoofing PayPal. Image: SilentPush. SilentPush found the Smishing Triad now spoofs recognizable brands in a variety of industry verticals across at least 121 countries and a vast number of industries, including the postal, logistics, telecommunications, transportation, finance, retail and public sectors. According to SilentPush, the domains used by the Smishing Triad are rotated frequently, with approximately 25,000 phishing domains active during any 8-day period and a majority of them sitting at two Chinese hosting companies: Tencent  and Alibaba . \u201cWith nearly two-thirds of all countries in the world targeted by  Smishing Triad, it\u2019s safe to say they are essentially targeting every country with modern infrastructure outside of Iran, North Korea, and Russia,\u201d SilentPush wrote. \u201cOur team has observed some potential targeting in Russia , but nothing definitive enough to indicate Russia is a persistent target. Interestingly, even though these are Chinese threat actors, we have seen instances of targeting aimed at Macau and Hong Kong, both special administrative regions of China.\u201d SilentPush\u2019s Zach Edwards said his team found a vulnerability that exposed data from one of the Smishing Triad\u2019s phishing pages, which revealed the number of visits each site received each day across thousands of phishing domains that were active at the time. Based on that data, SilentPush estimates those phishing pages received well more than a million visits within a 20-day time span. The report notes the Smishing Triad boasts it has \u201c300+ front desk staff worldwide\u201d involved in one of their more popular phishing kits \u2014 Lighthouse \u2014 staff that is mainly used to support various aspects of the group\u2019s fraud and cash-out schemes. The Smishing Triad members maintain their own Chinese-language sales channels on Telegram, which frequently offer videos and photos of their staff hard at work. Some of those images include massive walls of phones used to send phishing messages, with human operators seated directly in front of them ready to receive any time-sensitive one-time codes. As noted in February\u2019s story How Phished Data Turns Into Apple and Google Wallets, one of those cash-out schemes involves an Android app called Z-NFC, which can relay a valid NFC transaction from one of these compromised digital wallets to anywhere in the world. For a $500 month subscription, the customer can wave their phone at any payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app will relay an NFC transaction over the Internet from a stolen wallet on a phone in China. Chinese nationals were recently busted trying to use these NFC apps to buy high-end electronics in Singapore. And in the United States, authorities in California and Tennessee arrested Chinese nationals accused of using NFC apps to fraudulently purchase gift cards from retailers. The Prodaft researchers said they were able to find a previously undocumented backend management panel for Lucid, a smishing-as-a-service operation tied to the XinXin Group. The panel included victim figures that suggest the smishing campaigns maintain an average success rate of approximately five percent, with some domains receiving over 500 visits per week. \u201cIn one observed instance, a single phishing website captured 30 credit card records from 550 victim interactions over a 7-day period,\u201d Prodaft wrote. Prodaft\u2019s report details how the Smishing Triad has achieved such success in sending their spam messages. For example, one phishing vendor appears to send out messages using dozens of Android device emulators running in parallel on a single machine. Phishers using multiple virtualized Android devices to orchestrate and distribute RCS-based scam campaigns. Image: Prodaft. According to Prodaft, the threat actors first acquire phone numbers through various means including data breaches, open-source intelligence, or purchased lists from underground markets. They then exploit technical gaps in sender ID validation within both messaging platforms. \u201cFor iMessage, this involves creating temporary Apple IDs with impersonated display names, while RCS exploitation leverages carrier implementation inconsistencies in sender verification,\u201d Prodaft wrote. \u201cMessage delivery occurs through automated platforms using VoIP numbers or compromised credentials, often deployed in precisely timed multi-wave campaigns to maximize effectiveness. In addition, the phishing links embedded in these messages use time-limited single-use URLs that expire or redirect based on device fingerprinting to evade security analysis, they found. \u201cThe economics strongly favor the attackers, as neither RCS nor iMessage messages incur per-message costs like traditional SMS, enabling high-volume campaigns at minimal operational expense,\u201d Prodaft continued. \u201cThe overlap in templates, target pools, and tactics among these platforms underscores a unified threat landscape, with Chinese-speaking actors driving innovation in the underground economy. Their ability to scale operations globally and evasion techniques pose significant challenges to cybersecurity defenses.\u201d Ford Merrill works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company. Merrill said he\u2019s observed at least one video of a Windows binary that wraps a Chrome executable and can be used to load in target phone numbers and blast messages via RCS, iMessage, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. \u201cThe evidence we\u2019ve observed suggests the ability for a single device to send approximately 100 messages per second,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cWe also believe that there is capability to source country specific SIM cards in volume that allow them to register different online accounts that require validation with specific country codes, and even make those SIM cards available to the physical devices long-term so that services that rely on checks of the validity of the phone number or SIM card presence on a mobile network are thwarted.\u201d Experts say this fast-growing wave of card fraud persists because far too many financial institutions still default to sending one-time codes via SMS for validating card enrollment in mobile wallets from Apple or Google. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed multiple security executives at non-U.S. financial institutions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Those banks have since done away with SMS-based one-time codes and are now requiring customers to log in to the bank\u2019s mobile app before they can link their card to a digital wallet. This entry was posted on Thursday 10th of April 2025 11:31 AM If I had to install an app, I wouldn\u2019t use NFC payments, and then I\u2019d be less secure than before. There had better be a better way to authenticate than SMS or installing some proprietary garbage app from a bank to hand all my data to the adtech industry. When that day comes, it\u2019ll be back to good old fashioned CASH for me. \u201cGarbage app from a bank\u201d > Garbage 1-shot SMS authentication, though. If your bank doesn\u2019t put out an app you find \u201csuitable\u201d, A: What\u2019s unsuitable about it specifically, B: How do you personally know, and C: Why would you continue your relationship with the bank whose apps you don\u2019t trust for #reasons? If your bank doesn\u2019t respect info privacy choices in their app chances are good they\u2019re selling your info off the backend also, which again begs the question of why you would have a trust relationship with the bank you don\u2019t trust. * You know I\u2019ve been harping on about the banking/financial institutions lack of multi factor authentication for a long time now, but I\u2019ll piggy back off your comment to reiterate it once again for newcomers. If you are a US citizen and are curious what forms of multi factor authentication the banks in your country offer as a service, see the following link. .  I, like OP prefer not to use software authentication like a \u2018banking app\u2019, but rather the use of physical hardware like a Yubico YubiKey or Google Titan Key. The sad reality is of the 97 institutions in the link above, only 3 offer this option, and THAT is a disgrace. This goes to show much they really *care* about their customers. The problem with FIDO2 keys is that they do not securely display what you actually sign, so there is still the risk of approving something the user didn\u00b4t really want to approve. You are right. The limitation that FIDO2 keys don\u2019t display what\u2019s being signed is a legitimate concern, especially for high-assurance environments like banking where transaction signing matters. In contrast, some European banks using smart card readers or dedicated apps do offer contextual approval with transaction details shown to the user; which adds a crucial layer of transparency and prevents silent approvals of malicious actions. That said, it\u2019s important to put FIDO2\u2019s design into context: it was never built for transaction authorisation per se, but for phishing-resistant authentication. And in that role, it excels. Because FIDO2 ties authentication to the domain , an attacker can\u2019t trick the user into authenticating on a lookalike phishing site \u2014 even if the user clicks the wrong link. The key simply won\u2019t work unless the origin is cryptographically correct. Would I love to see transaction-level signing supported more broadly? Absolutely. But today, most US banks don\u2019t even authenticate securely, let alone authorise transactions securely. My frustration stems from how few of them even offer FIDO2/WebAuthn as an option \u2014 just 3 out of 97 per 2fa.directory. That\u2019s the real disgrace. SMS is barely MFA, and authenticator apps, while better, are still vulnerable to phishing and social engineering. Biometrics? Great for local device access, but meaningless if the device is compromised or rooted. And passkeys \u2014 while promising \u2014 are still finding their footing due to ecosystem fragmentation and vendor lock-in . Ideally, we\u2019d see a layered approach: FIDO2 for authentication , Transaction-aware confirmations through trusted channels ,and secure hardware fallback options like a YubiKey or biometric device tied to attestation. So yes, we\u2019re focusing on slightly different pieces of the puzzle. You\u2019re looking at what happens after auth , and I\u2019m highlighting the sad state of initial authentication options. But both need serious attention, especially in a time where phishing kits are evolving faster than the security controls most banks have currently put in place. That is fair comment but what would you suggest otherwise? SMS is practically obsolete. Authenticator apps are better but still phishable. Biometrics rely on device security, which is a weak link if the device is compromised. And while Passkeys show promise they are immature and still hampered by eco system fragmentation and vendor lock-in e.g., iCloud vs. Google. It\u2019s also worth noting that one of FIDO2\u2019s core strengths is phishing resistance via origin binding, that is, a key won\u2019t authenticate unless the domain matches exactly. So even if a user is tricked into visiting a convincing phishing site, their key simply won\u2019t respond. That\u2019s a huge step up from SMS or authenticator apps, which are easily tricked and replayed. And that is what the vast majority of readers here need protection against. Hardware keys are not perfect but when used in conjunction with other layers of security they offer greater defence against malicious actors than what is on offer from *most* mainstream US banking services today. No I don\u2019t have dementia \u2013 yet. Everyone may ignore this repetitive comment, as I thought my original was \u2018moderated\u2019, so I shortened it. I\u2019ve done worse. Really it\u2019s only 3 even now? Jeez. I know that implementing other forms of MFA is a top priority of several financial institutions in my area, but none are big enough to have their own app developers. So they have to rely on the vendors like FiServ, FIS, and Jack Henry who only care about this quarter\u2019s projections. Hell FiServ just a few years ago fired like half their employees, and I can only assume it was because they were responding to support tickets too quickly. I am really picky about what apps I install on my cell phone. What aggravates me is that it won\u2019t let me remove some apps that I am sure that I don\u2019t need at all. What is confusing is that from time to time I check the smart phone and find new game apps installed. There should be no game apps on my smart phone. I have never played a game app on the phone and am not about to start now. I have no idea how those apps are even installed. @ A \u2013 Regarding the precious comment about using cash: I am going to make a comment out of left field, which is not directly germane to the topic of the story. But it may inform a bit about the landscape of regular humans who also fear many things virtual, and desire to retain CASH as a medium of exchange. The folks I am specifically thinking about are fundamentalist Christians who have a narrative about the \u201cend times\u201d and think that the \u201cglobalists\u201d are intentionally preparing to eliminate \u201ccash money\u201d, as a method of control of \u201cwe the people\u201d. If a person thinks the End Times are imminent, and a symptom or indicator of that would be if the government tried to institute a universal version of cypto-currency in order to institute a \u201cnew global order\u201d. Most fundamentalist Christians have a high degree of distrust of all of our institutions and our tech, and perhaps with a certain amount of reason. If you are looking for any allies in keeping cash available as a payment option, there are many on the right that would agree. Text confirmation codes in general, or coming from your bank, do seem like a flaky way to do things. paint with a broad brush much? Cash is a great way to go as it saves the merchant the fees that payment processors charge. Not sure there\u2019s a big overlap between believers of imminent end-times and people who use mainly cash for payments. @BigP- yes, it is a broad brush, and not very well stated. I love cash for local things, for privacy, for saving local merchants from paying fees , and the feeling that I get from having a cash option available to me. . Also cash is good for making bail if you missed a child support payment or she did not tell the court you already paid it. By the same token you take a risk if you go to buy a used phone from a seller you have not verified. Criminals love cash too. **** You cannot easily make travel/hotel reservations or send flowers for a funeral. In my clumsy post, I was just imagining if the guberment tried to institute a compulsory cryptocurrency system where everything could be tracked and controlled.  btw-if you ever filled out the form for a fast-toll account, it neatly contains every salient fact of your life, all in one data base, that a hacker would love to have\u2026just because I\u2019m paranoid, does not mean \u201cthey\u201d aren\u2019t out to get me\u2026? Just remember to turn off \u201cSend Read Receipts\u201d on iPhone and the equivalent on Android before opening any suspect iMessage/RCS message so that phisher/scammer doesn\u2019t know they have reached a valid number and someone who reads their smishing messages. SMS confirmation codes are a sad mistake. \u201cSMS confirmation codes are a sad mistake.\u201d Yes. SS7 is quite old, and people fall for phishing easily. of course the US Gubmint is powerless to protect its citizens from such attacks and there is no \u2018both sides\u2019 Interestingly I received this message today from an outlook domain account\u2026 Apple Approval Notice We have noticed that your Apple iCloud id was recently used at \u201cAPPLE STORE \u2013 CA\u201d for $143.95, paid by Apple Pay Pre Authorization. Also some suspicious sign in request and apple pay activation request detected. That looks like suspicious to us. In order to maintain the security and privacy of your account we have placed those request on hold. Your Photos, Data, Bank Information and Cards are at risk. If NOT you? talk to an Apple Representative. Failing may lead to auto debit and charge will not be reversed. Call +18884048435 immediately to cancel this charge. It also has a URL at the end\u2026 Note the language of spam\u2026\u201dyour id\u201d, \u201cyour account\u201d, \u201cYour photos\u201d, etc. It\u2019s the same for every spam call/email/text, \u201cyour\u201d language because they have no idea who is receiving their call/email/text. @Matt ALWAYS CHECK THE \u201cFrom\u201d on your emails and you will see these do not come from any reputable source. I told my bank that I wish they would use digital signatures to verify that they are the true source of their e-mails. One thing that I have done is to set up separate e-mails for each bank and credit card company. The e-mails are rather convoluted and make little or no sense, but they are highly unlikely that anyone would ever accidentally send something to the e-mail by accident. They look more like a password than an e-mail address with something buried in the e-mail address to make it easy to identify which it is. For example, I could use hgqib.a5asb.prairie.bank.hssel.2qck7@example.com for an e-mail address for use with Bank of the Prairie. There is no need to make it easy to remember or to enter \u2014 you only have to enter it once when giving it to the bank and it is best to cut and paste it then. The bank stores it in their records and if they need to e-mail you, they will retrieve it from their records rather than entering it by hand. On the other hand, by checking the embedded text, it is immediately obvious whether which bank or credit card company it is used with. In my case, I do filtering to tag my incoming e-mails. When I get an e-mail from the bank\u2019s domains, it tags it with the banks name. If it is addressed to anything other than the special e-mail address, it also flags it with a \u201cWARNING\u201d tag. If you get an e-mail from the bank that doesn\u2019t use that address, then it is immediately highly suspicious. Unless the scammers manage to get the bank\u2019s records, they would never run across that address elsewhere and any e-mail address they manage to harvest from anywhere else would never be your banking e-mail address. SMS on the other hand is a cesspool of insecurity. Treat anything that arrives via SMS as being highly suspect In summary, the phishing falls into one of these: \u2013 \u201cyou owe a small debt, provide payment info\u201d\u2026  \u2013 \u201cyou need to prepay for shipping, or something\u201d\u2026 \u2013 \u201cyou need to approve this random payment\u201d\u2026 \u2013 \u201cyou are eligible for service protection or rewards, verify your account\u201d\u2026 Oh man, where to begin. First off, how come Apple can allow a single account to blast out more than a few messages per minute, let along 100 per second? Did any of those Apple geniuses think about limiting it?  Then those SMS messsges for 2Fa. :facepalm: Pretty much every bank in the U.S. thinks that they \u201cenhance\u201d my security by sending out 2FA codes via SMS. Although requiring me to use their dumb apps is not a solution either. Did they hear about Google Authenticator or Authy? It\u2019s using the various different app platforms, not 100 SMS per second AFAIK. Point taken either way. To expand, the Apple iOS hypervisor  isn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d of messages being sent in all the various platform apps which are e2e encrypted. It knows you\u2019re running n apps, it knows there\u2019s a connection between the device and some server linked to each app and it can probably see spikes in data transmission, but it can\u2019t see what they\u2019re \u2018doing\u2019 really, yet, *as far as the wider public is aware. This could change in some markets. The question is do we really want that, or can we live without it and combat scammers  in some other way. apnews.com/article/apple-iphone-britain-privacy-cybersecurity-encryption-5bc43477bee8cf32cbd81cd88a9463bd Your email address will not be published.

{"text": "The Powerful Code Editor for iPad and iPhone \u2014 Now Free to Try Late yesterday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rodgers issued a blistering opinion, concluding that Apple had willfully disregarded the Court\u2019s 2021 injunction, which found that the anti-steering provisions of the App Review Guidelines violated California state law. Judge Gonzalez Rodgers also referred Apple\u2019s conduct to the U.S. Attorney to investigate whether criminal prosecution of the company and one of its employees is warranted. For its part, Apple has said it disagrees with the decision and will appeal, but it will comply with the Court\u2019s order in the meantime. Judge Gonzalez Rodgers\u2019 80-page opinion and order don\u2019t pull any punches, painting a damning picture of Apple\u2019s response to the Court\u2019s injunction. If that all sounds like it\u2019s a big deal, that\u2019s because it is. Judge Gonzalez Rodgers\u2019 80-page opinion and order don\u2019t pull any punches, painting a damning picture of Apple\u2019s response to the Court\u2019s injunction. It\u2019s a unique and unflattering look behind the curtain at how Apple responded to the Court\u2019s 2021 order that\u2019s worth looking at more closely. The litigation between Epic Games and Apple has been ongoing for about five years. Here\u2019s my overview from last year on how it all began: This whole mess started in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic when Epic Games decided to manufacture a dispute with Apple by sneaking a store for purchasing Fortnite in-game currency into the mobile versions of that game. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store, Epic sued, claiming antitrust violations, Apple countersued for violations of its developer agreements, and the rest has unfolded over the course of over three years. In 2021, Judge Gonzalez Rodgers issued an order, finding that Apple wasn\u2019t a monopoly but ruling that the company had violated California state law prohibiting anticompetitive behavior by preventing developers from linking to external purchasing options in their apps. The parties appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the core of Judge Gonzalez Rodgers\u2019 decision, disagreeing only with a tangential issue regarding attorneys\u2019 fees. Apple appealed again to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the matter on January 16, 2024. The next day, Judge Gonzalez Rodgers\u2019 injunction went into effect. Then, on March 13 of last year, Epic Games filed a motion to enforce the Court\u2019s injunction and hold Apple in civil contempt for violating it, which is where the latest chapter in this epic tale begins. Judge Gonzalez Rodgers held hearings in May 2024 and again earlier this year. The first hearing centered around a report by Analysis Group, a consultancy whose reports Apple has pointed to repeatedly as support for the positive impact of the App Store on developers\u2019 businesses. The Court didn\u2019t buy what Apple and Analysis Group were selling: As testimony unfolded, and Apple attempted to justify its response, the Court became increasingly concerned that Apple was not only withholding critical information about its business decision for complying with the Injunction, but also that it had likely presented a reverse-engineered, litigation-ready justification for actions which on their face looked to be anticompetitive. . The Court\u2019s concern led to the second set of hearings, where it became clear that Apple began planning its response to the Court\u2019s injunction immediately after the Court\u2019s decision was published in 2021 . Apple is fond of code names, dubbing this initial effort at dealing with the injunction Project Michigan. Later, the working group was renamed Project Wisconsin. Code names like these are often used by Apple when developing new products to preserve secrecy; however, what makes perfect sense for product development is counterproductive when planning compliance with a court order. In that context, it just looks sneaky. Code names may look bad, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the Court\u2019s finding that evidence from the 2025 hearings told a very different story \u2014 one that directly contradicted testimony from the 2024 hearing: In stark contrast to Apple\u2019s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. . The contradictions between what was offered as evidence by Apple in 2024 and 2025 were so significant in the Court\u2019s eyes that Judge Gonzalez Rodgers referred the case to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for criminal investigation of Apple and Alex Roman, the employee that the Court concluded had lied under oath. In every instance, the Court found that Apple\u2019s response was designed to minimize compliance with its order and maximize the company\u2019s profits to the detriment of developers in a way that violated the order. Besides concluding that the 2024 hearing was effectively an attempt to cover up the decision-making happening behind the scenes, the Court made specific findings on how Apple\u2019s response to the injunction was a violation. Those findings touched on the 27% commission imposed on \u201clinked-out purchases,\u201d the design of links and buttons, friction imposed in the purchase flow to discourage shopping outside an app, and limitations on developer calls to action. If that sounds like the entirety of the changes made in response to the injunction, that\u2019s because it is. In every instance, the Court found that Apple\u2019s response was designed to minimize compliance with its order and maximize the company\u2019s profits to the detriment of developers in a way that violated the order. Unnamed sources at Apple have told 9to5Mac that the company disagrees with the Court\u2019s decision, but will comply and appeal. I doubt that appeal will go anywhere. The Court made it clear that it expected Apple to comply with its contempt order immediately, so an appeal won\u2019t delay that, barring intervention by the Court of Appeals. Given the deference higher courts afford to lower courts enforcing their own orders and the extensive evidentiary record, overturning it on appeal is a long shot. In the meantime, Apple is prohibited from: . For developers and users, the Court\u2019s decision opens up new opportunities. For any business where selling inside an app and paying Apple\u2019s fees was economically impossible, linking out offers new choices. We could see Bookshop.org or Amazon link out to the web so users can purchase books. Patreon could use links so creators can charge the same amount in Patreon\u2019s app as on the web. Fortnite should come back to the App Store, too. Plus, we\u2019ll undoubtedly see the release of a whole new set of apps that suddenly make economic sense but didn\u2019t before. That\u2019s the upside of competition. For Apple, this decision is quite simply devastating \u2013 not to its finances, but to its reputation and trust. For Apple, this decision is quite simply devastating \u2013 not to its finances, but to its reputation and trust. The Court\u2019s findings lay bare the corrosive effect that the App Store has had on Apple. To his credit, Phil Schiller opposed the 27% commission but was overruled by Apple\u2019s finance team, including then-CFO Luca Maestri. Schiller sat through the entire underlying trial and undoubtedly understood what the Judge\u2019s injunction meant better than any other senior executive at Apple, but he was still overruled in favor of remixing the very economic behavior that had been found to be anticompetitive. I also have to wonder where Apple\u2019s internal lawyers were in all of this. Attorney-client privilege means that most of those lawyers\u2019 interactions with management aren\u2019t public, but a general counsel\u2019s job is to prevent exactly what happened here. That means either management didn\u2019t listen to their own lawyers or those lawyers gave management bad advice, neither of which is good. Ultimately, though, what the Court\u2019s decision does is further damage Apple\u2019s reputation and trust with developers and, potentially, its users. I doubt most users pay close enough attention to this sort of thing for it to make a big difference to Apple, but a criminal indictment might. Developers, on the other hand, are acutely aware of the App Review Guidelines and the limitations they impose, and it\u2019s hard to see how Apple rebuilds trust with any developer who reads Judge Gonzalez Rodgers\u2019 decision and sees how the App Store sausage is made.

{"text": "App Store must now allow alternative payment options. Fortnite maker Epic Games is celebrating an enormous US court decision that forces Apple to allow alternative payment options on iPhone. This is the key issue that began the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games - when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut. The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple last night by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker \"in wilful violation\" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's \"anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing\". That particular injuction saw Apple being told it had to allow purchases for apps from outside websites, to which Apple agreed but then decided to levy a 27 percent fee when doing so - effectively restoring its regular app store cut. In fiery terms, the US court has now said this move \"strains credulity\" and branded it an \"obvious cover-up\" designed to allow Apple to continue with \"anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream\". The damning verdict echoes many of the arguments previously made by Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, who has campaigned against Apple's fresh barriers to outside payments. \"Apple's response,\" the court verdict reads, was to \"impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page 'scare' screens, static URLs, and generic statements. \"Apple's goal,\" the verdict continues, \"was to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction.\" More dramatic still, the court states that Apple documentation reveals the company \"knew what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", and that \"to hide the truth, vice-president of finance Alex Roman outright lied under oath\". Sweeney, who previously stated that Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case, took to social media last night to celebrate the decision - and state that Fortnite would return to the US iPhone App Store next week. \"NO FEES on web transactions,\" Sweeney wrote. \"Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple's 15-30 percent junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there. \"We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week. \"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.\" Eurogamer contacted Apple for comment, and asked whether it will be considering Sweeney's offer. \"We strongly disagree with the decision,\" an Apple spokesperson stated in response. \"We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\" Fortnite Android, iOS, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch Eurogamer is better when you sign in Join our community of gamers and get access to personalised reading recommendations and much more!

{"text": "Apple may have crossed the wrong judge When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. Apple does not hide its deeds under a bushel; When it \"lost\" the Epic  case last year, it quickly rolled out a series of changes to satisfy the injunction. If no one else realized Apple had somehow won by losing, Epic certainly knew it, with Epic CEO Tim Sweeney stating on X , \"The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers.\" In answer to that ruling, Apple started charging a 27% commission on App Store apps that chose to manage their own billing and forced them to apply for a special tool that let app developers include a button to outside billing systems. Additionally, Apple required that developers still support Apple's in-app billing system as an alternative to third-party ones. It was all there in black and white, but those decisions triggered what may be one of the most scathing rulings I have ever read. I mean, US District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers who has been presiding over this case for years is pissed. Was Apple trying to follow the letter of the law while skirting around the bits that might have any impact on its commission revenue business? As Judge Gonzalez sees it, yes. Don't believe me? Read this unedited bit from the court ruling: \"In stark contrast to Apple\u2019s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein,  more than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a violation. The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\" As the judge sees it, Apple may have used the ruling to further enrich its commission business: \"Prior to the Injunction, Apple did not allow 'linked-out purchases' and, thus, did not charge any commission for purchases made outside of, or off, its platform. Now, it does.\" The filing shows how Apple worked to fulfill the injunction in such a way that, while maybe opening new third-party billing and revenue avenues to developers, it also solidified Apple's hold on the process and commission collection. Judge Gonzalez paints this as a pretty nefarious operation with Apple willfully hiding and lying about its intentions. The thing is, Apple has never lied about its intentions regarding the App Store. Apple likes full-stack control for, well, control, but also so it can fulfill its security and privacy promises. An App Store where you can trust the majority of apps is not something that occurs naturally. You must set the parameters and ensure that every app that passes through those narrow gates does what it promised and is free from malware and spyware. It's no accident that your best iPhone is not riddled with malware or that you rarely download a fake app . The more open Apple is with its platforms, the more risk it incurs for itself and its customers. It's also clear, though, that Apple doesn't think much about methods or perception. If it was being forced to give third-party fulfillment systems access to App Store customers, then why not charge third-party developers for the pleasure? After all, the links to these platforms would come through Apple. Was that a deterrent to the development of such systems? Probably. Was that Apple's intention? I don't know. If you believe the injunction, you know some within Apple knew that Apple's methods of compliance were too close to flouting the law. Those voices, though, did not win. Former Apple CFO Luca Maestri, once a voice of reason on Apple earnings calls, is named a key champion of potentially bad ideas. As for what Apple does next, well, I'm sure it will fight, but there's also no way it can ignore Judge Gonzales' closing statement: \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers\u2019 ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.\" If this ruling holds, which is not a certainty as Apple plans to appeal, it may trigger sweeping changes that could forever alter the way we use the App Store. The loss of a fully closed system may not be the best thing for consumers. Still, it gives developers the flexibility many have been craving and effectively takes the Apple commission  off the table for transactions happening outside the platform, even if users found that link from inside Apple's App Store. Epic is already planning for a best-case scenario and quickly announced that Fortnite will return to the App Store next week with, I'm sure, in-app purchases , all taking you outside Apple's platform. We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.  30, 2025 This might be the first effective crack in Apple's \"reality distortion field,\" one that refashions reality to suit its needs. We've seen it at work this year with Apple not delivering the full Apple Intelligence experience but telling consumers that the iPhone 16 comes with it. It has since quietly removed some of that language from product pages. Apple has rarely admitted mistakes or shortcomings, and while this ruling isn't a sign that Apple will start now, it appears to have no choice but to deconstruct the distortion field it built around app developer choice. As for the injunction, it reads like the final word on the subject: \"Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court\u2019s Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the coverup made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple. \" Ouch.

{"text": "By Luke Dormehl \u2022 5:45 am, April 11, 2025 April 11, 1976: Apple releases its first computer, the Apple-1. Designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak, the computers are sold wholesale by \u201cSteven\u201d Jobs. To finance their manufacturing, Wozniak sells his HP-65 calculator for $500, while Jobs sells his Volkswagen van. While the machine itself was quite rudimentary, the Apple-1 laid the foundation the personal computing era for Apple\u2019s incredible future success. In terms of specs, the first Apple computer was incredibly primitive. An 8-bit MOS 6502 microprocessor running at 1 MHz powered the machine. It came with 4KB of memory as standard, although expansion cards could boost this to 8KB or 48KB. Users had to add their own keyboard and monitor, although the latter could be a regular TV set, which made the Apple-1 innovative for its day.  Wozniak started working on the computer as a hobby, with no goal beyond showing it off to the people at the local Homebrew Computer Club, a hobbyist group whose meetings he attended in Menlo Park, California. \u201cI did this computer \u2026 to show the people at Homebrew that it was possible to build a very affordable computer \u2014 a real computer you could program for the price of the Altair \u2014 with just a few chips,\u201d Wozniak recalled in his autobiography, iWoz. His partner Steve Jobs convinced Woz that they would do better building and selling the Apple-1 rather than giving away the designs. Then Jobs approached Paul Terrell, who owned The Byte Shop in nearby Mountain View, California, one of the first personal computer stores. Terrell rejected Jobs\u2019 first suggestion that the Apple-1 should come in kit form. He told Jobs that, with computers becoming more mainstream, people wanted to buy fully assembled machines. Jobs listened and agreed. So, Terrell said he would buy 50 Apple-1 computers for $500 each, although cash would only be paid upon delivery. Terrell then marked up the computers to $666.66, or the equivalent of more than $3,700 today.  Ultimately, the Apple-1 didn\u2019t hang around too long. Apple only built 200 or so of its first computers. The number of surviving units is significantly smaller today, due to both the computers\u2019 age and the fact that Apple offered a trade-in deal when it launched the significantly upgraded Apple II the following year. Looking back, the Apple-1 seems quaint compared to the supercomputers we carry in our pockets today. But in 1976, its launch was a pivotal moment. This handmade machine gave rise to a trillion-dollar empire that made computing easy and ubiquitous with revolutionary products like the iPhone and the Mac.

Following the court ruling, Epic announced that Fortnite would return to the iOS App Store based on the new provisions Apple was expected to implement. Now in 2025, Apple still does not offer any practical way for developers, including Epic, to use external payment systems for their apps and games. Epic returned to court, claiming that Apple has not complied with the court's order. Today, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled that Apple is willfully violating the Court\u2019s 2021 injunction. Here's the exact wording from the ruling: Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court\u2019s Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the cover up made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple. The judge also ruled that Alex Roman, Apple\u2019s Vice President of Finance, lied under oath. The United States Attorney may decide whether to initiate a criminal prosecution against Apple and its Vice President of Finance. Accordingly, under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Court refers the issue to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, Patrick D. Robbins, or his designee, for investigation against Apple and Alex Roman, Apple\u2019s Vice President of Finance specifically. The Court takes no position on whether a criminal prosecution is or is not warranted. The decision is entirely that of the United States Attorney. It will be for the executive branch to decide whether Apple should be deprived of the fruits of its violation, in addition to any penalty geared to deter future misconduct. Tim Sweeney, Epic Games founder and CEO, tweeted that Fortnite will be coming back to the US iOS App Store next week. He also offered a peace proposal for Apple if they extend the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide. In return, Epic will bring Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax.

{"text": "Just one successful hack could cause you to lose everything\u2014your data, your account, and your peace of mind. That's why I ditched text messages and authenticator codes and switched to a safer alternative. Switching to a security key completely changed how I log in\u2014it's much faster and easier. Two-factor authentication  used to be such a pain. I'd have to grab my phone, find a text code , and type in a six-digit code before it expires. But now, with a security key, all that's a thing of the past. Now, I just plug into my computer or connect wirelessly via NFC  to authenticate my login. It\u2019s highly secure and lightning-fast, so I no longer wait for delayed text messages or worry about typing in the wrong code. Just a quick tap or click, and I'm in. I've even set it up for multiple accounts: email, Instagram, X, and more. It's like having one passkey that unlocks all my digital doors. Two-factor authentication  adds an extra layer of security to your account, though all 2FA options are not the same. SMS codes can be intercepted, and app authenticators  still rely on software that can be compromised if your phone is lost, stolen, or hacked. Security keys, however, use strong encryption and communicate only with legitimate websites. Built on the FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards, they use cryptography to ensure you're logging into a real site, not a fake one designed to steal your info. If a hacker tricks you with a fake login page, your key won't react. That level of phishing protection is something no other 2FA method can match. Big names like Facebook, X, and Microsoft use security keys. Apple now supports them for Apple ID and two-factor authentication, while Google uses them internally to secure employee accounts. Cybersecurity experts and organizations like NIST and ENISA call physical security keys the gold standard for account protection. I might not be a big target, but knowing I'm using the same protection trusted by cybersecurity pros gives me real peace of mind. Another thing I love about a security key is that it works entirely offline\u2014no phone is required. Even if my phone gets lost or stolen, I'm still in control because the key isn't tied to it. I remember one time when I was traveling, my phone battery died. With regular 2FA, I'd have been locked out, but with a security key, that's not a problem anymore. It doesn't need a signal or the internet to do its thing. As long as I have the key, I can log in on any device, whether I'm 30,000 feet up using airplane Wi-Fi or hiking in the middle of nowhere with no reception. It's the ultimate backup to stay secure anywhere, anytime. No apps to install, no codes to fumble with, and no batteries to worry about. The security key takes care of everything itself. Phishing emails and fake login pages are everywhere, and even smart users slip up sometimes. With regular two-factor authentication, if you enter your code on a phony site, an attacker can use it right away. However, security keys are built to prevent that nightmare scenario. They use a feature called origin binding, which means they only work on legitimate websites. So, if I plug my key into a fake site pretending to be my bank, it won't work, as the key knows something's off and refuses to log in. Big companies have adopted security keys to stop phishing with great success. For example, according to Krebs on Security, Google made all employees use them and hasn't had a single phishing incident on work accounts since. Cloudflare, another major tech company, faced a sophisticated phishing attack that tricked some employees, but attackers couldn't access accounts because the security keys blocked them. These real-life examples boost my confidence. If a simple $25 key like a USB-C Yubikey can block phishing attacks that even big tech companies worry about, it's enough to protect me from everyday scams. Using a key feels like having a phishing shield that's always on. I feel much safer logging into sensitive accounts like email or finance, where one phishing mistake could be a huge problem. Beyond phishing, security keys also protect me from SIM-swapping attacks. Basically, SIM swapping occurs when a scammer tricks your mobile carrier into transferring your number to their SIM card. Once they have your number, they can intercept your SMS codes or calls, giving them access to accounts that use 2FA using text messages. There have been high-profile cases, like when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's account was hacked through a SIM swap. Some cryptocurrency investors have also lost large sums after their phone numbers were stolen. Hearing these stories was chilling\u2014it made it clear that SMS-based security isn't as safe as I once thought. Security keys, however, are completely immune to SIM swapping. Since my key isn't tied to my phone number or carrier, there's nothing for a hacker to reroute. A scammer can't call my provider and transfer my key as they can with a SIM card. They'd literally have to steal the device, and even then, they'd still need my password or PIN on the key. That's why cybersecurity experts say the best way to defeat phone-based attacks is to avoid relying on your phone. And a security key does exactly that. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved But what if you lose the key? Sure, that could be an issue. But you can set up other 2FA options like authenticator apps , backup codes, or even a trusted device with 2FA already enabled, so you don\u2019t have to worry about getting locked out. Don't buy a security key. Yes, they are a good idea, but I've discovered that there is almost no support for them. Even places that claim to support them, the support is very weak. For example I bought two Yubaco security keys to work specifically on my Proton Password Manager, but it never works as it should. I always have to use some other form of 2fa. My observation is that companies like Proton and Google are pushing passkeys, not security keys. Yes in my experience Security Keys are dead with little to no support. As Jim mentions, the IT World is pushing Passkeys with Microsoft making it mandatory for some of the AD & Mail Administration tasks forcing Admins to switch to Passkeys. Chance to loss phone or key should be same but phone is always used but key is only used when needed Your smartphone notes app is simply not safe, but it's easy to move to a more secure password solution. That 90-day rule is making your accounts less secure. Proton Pass is much more than just a bog-standard password manager. Passkeys are the future. Don't wait to find out if your password is compromised the hard way; use these tools and be proactive. Is your information on the dark web? Time to find out.", "summary": "Switching to a security key completely changed how I log in .<n>It's highly secure and lightning-fast .<n>It's like having one passkey that unlocks all my digital doors ."}
