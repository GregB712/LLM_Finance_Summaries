Apple court case, judge US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to allow third-party developers to tell users how to make payments inside iOS applications without going through Apple’s App Store. As we have come to expect from Apple, the company maliciously complied, lowering the commission on purchases outside of its ecosystem from 30% to 27%, while also adding a whole bunch of hoops and hurdles, like scare screens with doom-and-gloom language to, well, scare consumers into staying within Apple’s ecosystem for in-app payments. Well, it turns out Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is furious, giving Apple, Tim Cook, and its other executives what can only be described as a beatdown – even highlighting how one of Apple’s executives, under orders from Tim Cook, lied under oath several times. Gonzalez is referring this to the District Attorney for Northern California “to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.” In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein, more than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a violation. The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. Gonzalez’ entire ruling is scathing, seething with rage, and will probably do more reputational damage to Apple, Tim Cook, and his executive team than any bendgate or antennagate could ever do. Judge Gonzalez: This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases. Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court’s Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the cover-up made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple. Gonzalez effectively destroyed any ability for Apple to charge commissions on purchases made inside iOS applications but outside Apple’s App Store, and this order will definitely find its way to the European Union as well, where it will serve as further evidence of Tim Cook’s and Apple’s continuous, never-ending contempt for the law and courts that uphold it. For its part, Apple has stated they’re going to appeal. Good luck with that.  Follow me on Mastodon @[email protected] You must be logged in to post a comment.

Brad Pitt is now an A24 star.

Deadline first reported the project. “The Riders” follows Fred Scully (Pitt), who, after traveling Europe with his wife, Jennifer, and seven-year-old daughter, Billie, purchases a farmhouse in rural Ireland. Jennifer and Billie then return to Australia to finalize their affairs, only for Billie to return to Ireland alone after traveling across the globe, with Jennifer now missing. Fred is left to make sense of his wife’s disappearance in a story that takes a mystical turn.

EXCLUSIVE: Two-time Academy Award nominee Jacki Weaver (Animal Kingdom, Silver Linings Playbook) is set to star alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Phoebe Dynevor and Norman Reedus in the Darren Aronofsky-produced feature Pendulum. The horror movie is currently shooting in New Mexico. 
	From screenwriter and director Mark Heyman (Black Swan), Pendulum follows young couple Patrick (Gordon-Levitt) and Abigail (Dynevor) on a journey to a new-age retreat in New Mexico, drawn by the possibility of recovering with the much-revered mystical healer Ella-Rose (Weaver) after going through a traumatic event. 

	








 
	Patrick is willing to do anything to help his wife but becomes distrustful of Ella-Rose even as Abigail falls under her spell. As paranoia builds, the couple must determine whether Ella-Rose’s intense spiritual practices offer genuine healing or mask a terrifying truth that threatens to consume them both.

6,summary_google/pegasus-multi_news,Apple is no longer permitted to charge fees on purchases made outside App Store apps,"A judge in the United States has ruled that Apple’s 15-30 percent commission fee on purchases made outside the App Store apps is anti-competitive and must stop. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers just killed Apple’s anti-steering rule in the Epic Games v. Apple case, saying Apple cannot charge a 15-30 percent commission fee on purchases that iPhone owners make outside the App Store apps. As a result, third-party developers can now accept web payments without paying Apple fees. Apple charges a commission on all payments made through its In-App Purchase mechanism, which provides seamless billing and a number of other benefits. The main point of contention between third-party developers like Epic Games and Apple has been external purchases made on the web, like V-Bucks for Fortnite. Apple thinks it’s entitled to a cut on web purchases, but the judge called it anticompetitive behavior, slamming the company for “willfully” avoiding to comply with the previous injunction from the original 2021 ruling. “That [Apple] thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,” the judge said. The original ruling said Apple must permit developers to inform users about alternative payments that are available externally, on the web. Instead of complying with the ruling, Apple created a new policy demanding that developers instead pay a 27 percent fee on such purchases. However, the judge called out Apple’s behavior in today’s ruling, accusing the firm of trying to “maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this court’s injunction.” She added that Phil Schiller, who runs the App Store, advised Apple CEO Tim Cook to comply with her 2021 decision, but that Apple’s boss “chose poorly” by letting finance chief Luca Maestri “convince him otherwise.” For further information, check out Techmeme’s roundup of news coverage and commentary. NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple’s 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there. 4 years 4 months 17 days. https://t.co/RucrsX7Z4A pic.twitter.com/3kSYnt5pcI — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) April 30, 2025  The 80-page ruling explicitly prohibits Apple from charging any commission fee on purchases made outside an app. Apple also imposed heavy restrictions on how third-party developers inform people within apps that other payment options are available on the web. Those restrictions are gone now, too, as the ruling prohibits Apple from blocking or limiting the use of such buttons or other calls to action. Moreover, Apple is barred from restricting developers’ style, formatting or placement of links for purchases outside of an app. And when you decide to click a button to make a purchase outside of an app, Apple cannot throw up any scare screens; according to the ruling, the only messaging allowed here is “a neutral message apprising users that they are going to a third-party site.” Companies specializing in web and in-app payments like RevenueCat have already seized the opportunity, so RevenueCat just announced that developers can now use its Paywalls service to point customers to the web for checkout. The screenshots RevenueCat shared illustrate why the judge’s ruling is going to cost Apple dearly: the in-app buttons and the wording make it perfectly clear that you can buy the same subscription on the web up to thirty percent cheaper. Thirty percent is nothing to sneeze at, especially in an economy like this. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney announced on X that Fortnite is returning to the App Store in the United States as early as “next week.” He also floated a peace proposal to the iPhone maker, saying that “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.” Fortnite is available as a direct download on iPhone in the European Union as of February 2024 due to Apple’s compliance with the Digital Markets Act.

10,summary_google/pegasus-multi_news,The hammer falls on Apple’s malicious-compliance scheme,"May 1, 2025 8:27 AM PT U.S. District Court judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled largely in Apple’s favor in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit back in 2021, but she did find that Apple’s requirement that apps only use Apple’s payment methods and not link to external methods was fundamentally anticompetitive. So she ordered Apple to change its behavior. After two failed appeals, Apple was forced to follow her orders. In a judgment handed out on Wednesday, Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple acted in contempt by failing to follow her orders and scheming to find ways to avoid them, that at least one executive lied under oath, and concluded that Apple has so brazenly botched the aftermath of her order that several of its longstanding App Store policies are now entirely void. It was a bad day in court for Apple. And a self-inflicted one. As Gonzalez Rogers writes in her finding: 
  Apple’s response to the Injunction strains credulity. After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction’s goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream. Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up.
 What the judge found back in 2021 was that Apple’s 30 percent cut of App Store in-app purchases was fundamentally uncompetitive, as was Apple’s rule that prevented app developers from pointing users to external purchase options on the web. She ordered that Apple change its behavior, but instead Apple did pretty much what we all imagined they had done: cook up a scheme that seemed to follow the order but made the result so unpalatable that developers would opt for the status quo instead. Thanks to the power of the subpoena, Gonzalez Rogers has brought receipts. There’s a large document trail indicating that Apple reverse engineered a 27% commission for external transactions (including a lengthy post-referral royalty period) in order to make them no better than just using Apple’s own internal payment system. When a major app developer pointed out that the overhead of external payment systems was more than the commonly-cited 3% (meaning that the entire thing would be a net money loser), Apple celebrated the good news. Apple also attempted to engineer the directive to allow external links in apps by creating new barriers and requirements that would similarly defang those orders. It created full-page “scare screens” (I referred to them as “This App May Kill You” screens), demanded that all links be to static URLs (neutering their utility), and kept editing the warning labels to dissuade users as much as possible from ever agreeing to follow the link. (Cook is specifically credited with amping up the language in the warning screens.) The company’s internal struggle is fascinating to read about. While Apple Fellow and longtime App Store overseer Phil Schiller doesn’t come across entirely smelling like a rose, he does end up looking far better than literally any other Apple employee in the ruling. Schiller “advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction”—imagine that!—while Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, and the company’s finance team instead decided to concoct a strategy of malicious compliance that led to the poison pill of the 27% commission. “Cook chose poorly,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote. Not only did Apple attempt to find ways to circumvent the injunction, but it fatally hid their discussions from the judge. While Schiller gets credit from Gonzalez Rogers for sitting through the trial and reading the final decision1, the judge suggests that his colleagues at Apple did not. Most troubling is the behavior of Apple’s Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, who the judge says “outright lied under oath” multiple times. She referred her ruling to the U.S. Attorney’s office in San Francisco for possible criminal prosecution of Apple generally and Roman specifically. “At every step Apple considered whether its actions would comply, and at every step Apple chose to maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream over compliance,” she wrote. Because Apple has proven itself untrustworthy, the judge has decided that the time for talk is over. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation,” she wrote Wednesday. “There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.” As a result, she has now enjoined Apple entirely from impeding the ability of developers to communicate with users or charging a commission for external transactions. In other words, Apple had its chance to comply, but since it refused to do so reasonably, it’s going to get hammered. In the least surprising response possible, Apple says it will appeal. Maybe this time it’ll take things a bit more seriously. If you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

 Just a day after a major court ruling reaffirmed that Apple needs to allow app developers to point outside its ecosystem for payments and that it cannot collect fees on such purchases, Epic announced an alternative way for developers to collect payments. Epic has announced that starting June 2025, all payments processed via the Epic Games Store will pay a zero percent revenue share to the company until they reach $1 million in revenue. After that, Epic's usual 88%-12% split will kick in. It all started when Apple faced a setback in 2021 when the court ruled against it and said that it cannot restrict app developers from including buttons, external links, or other call-to-actions within their apps to direct customers to external payment systems. However, Apple did not make the necessary changes even in 2025, which compelled Epic to return to the court. On April 30, 2025, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled in the District Court for the Northern District of California that Apple ""willfully chose not to comply with this Court’s Injunction"" and that it did so with ""the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers"". The judge also ruled that Apple's Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, lied under oath about implementing a 27% commission fee on purchases made outside of the App Store in January 2024. However, documents revealed that this decision was actually made in July 2023. Now that external payments are coming, Epic is also finally bringing Fortnite to the U.S. App Store on iOS devices. The company also says that it will release a new feature that will allow developers to launch their own ""webshops,"" which will be hosted on the Epic Games Store. These webshops can offer players out-of-app purchases, as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees. With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States. Players who purchase their items via Epic Webshops will also accrue 5% Epic Rewards on all purchases.

16,summary_google/pegasus-multi_news,Google Pixel 9 Price Slashed In Serious New $200 Sale,"ByJanhoi McGregor  ByJanhoi McGregor,  Senior Contributor.  The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg This story was updated on April 11th with new Pixel 9a sale details.  Following the Apple iPhone 16 price drop and Samsung’s free Galaxy Watch giveaway, the Google Pixel 9 has joined in with the spring discounts. Don’t forget to hit the follow button above for the latest smartphone pricing news.  Amazon has slashed the price of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL by $204 for the 128GB option, bringing the price down to $894.99. A huge discount for the company’s top flagship model, especially considering the pricing uncertainty because of incoming trade tariffs. The base Pixel 9 has also been discounted by $151.75, bringing the price down to $647. The Pixel 9 Pro and Google Pixel 8 series, however, are still at full price. While the base Pixel 9 deal mimics an Amazon sale last month, the Pixel 9 Pro XL price is one of the biggest discounts I have seen yet. Google has typically knocked $150 off its top handset in the promotions it has run since the devices launched last August. But a straight $200 discount beats those sales comfortably. Amazon can undercut the companies that make these smartphones partly because you’re buying the phone and nothing else. While Samsung and Google will throw in some freebies, store credit or access to subscription services, Amazon’s no-thrill deals involve the device with no extras. The low price also balances Amazon’s poor trade-in valuations. Take a look at the selection of prices Amazon will pay for a used handset against Google’s pricing below (which itself is distinctly average). Google is only beaten on the Apple handset. Note that Amazon doesn’t accept any Google devices beyond the Pixel 5. If you want the best possible price for your old phone, you might be better off selling it on the secondary market. Even with all of the fees and rigmarole that entails. If now is not the right time to pick up a new Pixel phone, Amazon, Google and other retailers will discount the Google Pixel 9 series again, especially as we inch closer to the Pixel 10 release this summer. Update Friday 11th April: Google has officially launched the Pixel 9a and with it a slew of new promotions. First up, the Search company is giving away a $100 store credit with Pixel 9a purchases. Crucially, this can’t be used on the handset itself, rather towards your next buy. Buyers can pick up the Pixel Buds A-series for $99, which is clearly the intention behind that offer. As we have seen before with Samsung, budget wearables are a good makeweight in deals like this. Google has also upped its trade-in prices for your old phone. The company says you can pick up the Pixel 9a for as little as $99 with the right trade-in. That, of course, means handing over a Pixel 8 Pro, or Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. You can get the new phone for free if you swap in the original Pixel Fold or iPhone 15 Pro Max. A slightly more realistic trade-in is the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is worth $405, but that still feels like a downgrade to me. None of these phones should be traded in for the Pixel 9a. More sensical deals include $200 for the Pixel 7a, $280 for the iPhone 14 and $180 for the Pixel 6 Pro.

Apple lost 9% on Thursday and it was the second largest notional loss in history. (Photo by Eric ... More Thayer/Getty Images) Key Takeaways There’s an old expression on Wall Street. Stocks stair-step higher and go down like jumping out a window. What we saw on Thursday and Friday morning in the premarket is more like off a high rise. On Thursday, stocks lost $3.1 trillion, their worst day since back in March of 2020. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%. Tech stocks led the Nasdaq 6% lower. The Russell 2000 dropped 6.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4%. Ten of the eleven sectors in the S&P were lower on Thursday with energy turning in the worst performance, down 7.5%. The sole sector that was up on the day was consumer staples, gaining 0.7%. Digging beneath the surface, the carnage was even worse with a number of stocks, which were already down on the year, falling 10%. Apple, which was down 9% on Thursday experienced the second largest notional loss in the market's history. Looking at the premarket, the selling looks set to continue. After the close Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced his tariff plans, set to go into effect on April 9. The rates, which many thought was already being priced into markets, were significantly more severe than anticipated. Included in his announcement, the European Union will be taxed at 20%. China, which is already under tariffs, will see an additional 34% increase. A 10% tariff on all imported goods was also announced. According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, that will bring the overall weighted-average tariffs to 23%. Following the U.S. announcement on tariffs, other countries began responding with tariffs of their own. The biggest retaliatory announcement came early Friday morning from China. The Finance Ministry in China announced they would impose 34% tariffs on all U.S. imports, starting on April 10. In addition, China also announced they were suspending certain agricultural products and that they would be tightening export controls on certain rare Earth items. With a full-scale trade war now taking place, odds of a recession in the U.S. have been steadily climbing. JPMorgan has placed the odds of a recession at 60%. While there may be good reason to view any economic forecast with a degree of skepticism, the evidence of a potential recession is showing up in places in the market outside of equities. Oil prices, which touched $72 per barrel on Wednesday, have since fallen over 15% to just over $61 in premarket. Oil prices are used as a proxy for economic health as a strong economy requires more oil, driving prices higher. Weakness in oil is often interpreted as a recessionary indicator. In addition to the fall in oil prices, we're seeing bond prices move higher and interest rates plummet. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note is now below 3.9%. That rate was as high as 4.77% at the beginning of the year. This morning, we received the most recent look at employment. According to Bloomberg, estimates were for 139 thousand new jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.1%. The number of jobs created was higher, at 228,000, while the unemployment rate was 4.2%. There were some sizable revisions however, with both January and February seeing downward revisions totaling 48,000 fewer jobs than were originally reported. For Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak at 10:25 a.m. CT. While I expect him to bob and weave like Muhammad Ali, markets may be looking to him for some sort of assurance that the Fed is willing to cut rates if needed. In addition to Powell, I'm keeping my eye on some individual stocks, like Alibaba, which is off 13% from its high last month. I'm also watching the VIX. I've spoken about the orderly selloffs we've been seeing and how VIX never really jumped to a level where you might see panic selling. In the premarket, VIX has been as high as 45.56, but has since pulled back some to just under 40. Anything over 30 is when you begin seeing panic seep in and that could lead to some choppy trading. For option traders though, the high VIX means option premium is expensive and there may be opportunities for selling that premium.

Updated on:  April 30, 2025 / 10:36 PM EDT
          / CBS/AP
         A federal judge has strongly rebuked Apple, finding that the iPhone maker willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. On Wednesday, she found that Apple violated a 2021 injunction that, she wrote, sought to ""restrain and prohibit the iPhone maker's anticompetitive conduct"" and pricing. ""Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote in Wednesday's ruling, which held Apple in contempt. She ordered that Apple ""no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases."" In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday night, an Apple spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.""   Epic first filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce. Although Gonzalez Rogers had rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. The Supreme Court rejected Apple's appeal in the case in January 2024. ""In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,"" the judge wrote on Wednesday. She accused Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman of ""outright"" lying under oath. ""Internally, (longtime Apple executive) Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but (CEO) Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote. The judge referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.

All rights reserved.","Watch CBS News Updated on: April 30, 2025 / 10:36 PM EDT / CBS/AP A federal judge has strongly rebuked Apple, finding that the iPhone maker willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. On Wednesday, she found that Apple violated a 2021 injunction that, she wrote, sought to ""restrain and prohibit the iPhone maker's anticompetitive conduct"" and pricing. ""Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote in Wednesday's ruling, which held Apple in contempt. She ordered that Apple ""no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases."" In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday night, an Apple spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal."" Epic first filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce. Although Gonzalez Rogers had rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. The Supreme Court rejected Apple's appeal in the case in January 2024. ""In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,"" the judge wrote on Wednesday. She accused Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman of ""outright"" lying under oath. ""Internally,  Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but  Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote. The judge referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.

 Sabrina Carpenters of the world, rejoice! Fortnite is coming back to iPhones. A judge in California ruled that Apple willfully violated a court order back in 2020 when it removed Epic Games as a developer from the iOS App Store. And the ruling is salty! Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,” Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order … The Court will not tolerate further delays.” Epic and Apple have been beefing since August 2020, when the video-game developer accused the tech behemoth of being an “unlawful monopoly” by taxing devs 30 percent of their online purchases. Epic filed an antitrust suit, and Apple wound up deleting Epic’s account from the App Store. Sounds shady, no? The court agrees. “Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases,” Rogers wrote. She also accused Apple’s VP of finance, Alex Roman, of lying under oath, writing, “Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.” Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney did a victory lap on X. “We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week,” he wrote. “Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.” Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.

26,summary_google/pegasus-multi_news,"China hits back at Trump tariffs with 34% tax on US goods, export curbs","Beijing says it will impose an additional 34 percent tax on US goods from next week in retaliation for Washington’s tariffs. China has announced a slew of countermeasures against tariffs imposed by United States President Donald Trump, including additional tariffs of 34 percent on all goods and curbs on the export of some rare earths, deepening an escalating trade war. Trump on Wednesday announced that China would be hit with a 34-percent tariff, on top of the 20 percent he imposed earlier this year, bringing the total new levies to 54 percent. On Friday, China’s Ministry of Finance said the additional tariffs would be imposed from April 10. Beijing has previously imposed tariffs of 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US in retaliation for Washington’s 10 percent levies on Chinese goods. It also announced stiff export controls on key minerals and businesses, limiting what could be exchanged with the US. “The purpose of the Chinese government’s implementation of export controls on relevant items in accordance with the law is to better safeguard national security and interests, and to fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation,” the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. On Friday morning, Trump responded to the slate of retaliatory measures with a fiery social-media post written in all capital letters. “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. But China has pushed forward with countering Trump’s aggressive trade policies, saying it had opened a formal complaint against the new US tariffs with the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday. As part of its complaint, Beijing argued the measures violate WTO rules and requesting consultations. “China has filed the WTO complaint with respect to the United States’ measures,” the Permanent Mission of China to the World Trade Organization said in a statement. Beijing also imposed sweeping export controls to limit the exchange of goods and services with the US. Some pertained to the export of medium and heavy rare earths to the US, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, effective from April 4. Others took aim at US businesses. China added 16 US entities to its export control list, which bans the export of dual-use items to affected firms. Another 11 US firms were included on the “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive action against foreign entities. The targeted firms includes Skydio Inc and BRINC Drones over arms sales to democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the targeted companies seriously “undermined” China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests and would be banned from new investments, import and export activities in China. Agriculture trade took a hit as well, as Chinese customs imposed an immediate suspension on imports of sorghums from grain exporter C&D (USA) Inc, as well as poultry and bonemeal from three US firms. Then there were the threats of further regulatory action. Beijing announced it had launched an anti-dumping probe, looking into imports of certain medical CT tubes from the US and India. It also said it would pursue a wider investigation into how the medical industry’s competitiveness was affected by imports of medical CT tubes. US stock futures fell sharply on Friday, signalling more losses on Wall Street, as the Trump administration’s sweeping levies knocked $2.4 trillion from US equities. Shares of Big Tech stocks fell in premarket trading, with companies such as Apple and Nvidia having big exposure to China and Taiwan for manufacturing their products. In Japan, a top US trading partner, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said the tariffs had created a “national crisis”, as a plunge in banking shares on Friday set Tokyo’s stock market on course for its worst week in years. European shares were also headed for the biggest weekly loss in three years. But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday disputed any economic crash, telling reporters that markets were reacting to the change and would adjust. “Their economies are not crashing. Their markets are reacting to a dramatic change in the global order in terms of trade,” he said at a media conference in Brussels. “The markets will adjust.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Beijing says it will impose an additional 34 percent tax on US goods from next week in retaliation for Washington’s tariffs.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg This story was updated on April 11th with new Pixel 9a sale details.  Following the Apple iPhone 16 price drop and Samsung’s free Galaxy Watch giveaway, the Google Pixel 9 has joined in with the spring discounts. Don’t forget to hit the follow button above for the latest smartphone pricing news.  Amazon has slashed the price of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL by $204 for the 128GB option, bringing the price down to $894.99. A huge discount for the company’s top flagship model, especially considering the pricing uncertainty because of incoming trade tariffs. The base Pixel 9 has also been discounted by $151.75, bringing the price down to $647. The Pixel 9 Pro and Google Pixel 8 series, however, are still at full price. While the base Pixel 9 deal mimics an Amazon sale last month, the Pixel 9 Pro XL price is one of the biggest discounts I have seen yet. Google has typically knocked $150 off its top handset in the promotions it has run since the devices launched last August. But a straight $200 discount beats those sales comfortably. Amazon can undercut the companies that make these smartphones partly because you’re buying the phone and nothing else. While Samsung and Google will throw in some freebies, store credit or access to subscription services, Amazon’s no-thrill deals involve the device with no extras. The low price also balances Amazon’s poor trade-in valuations. Take a look at the selection of prices Amazon will pay for a used handset against Google’s pricing below (which itself is distinctly average). Google is only beaten on the Apple handset. Note that Amazon doesn’t accept any Google devices beyond the Pixel 5. If you want the best possible price for your old phone, you might be better off selling it on the secondary market. Even with all of the fees and rigmarole that entails. If now is not the right time to pick up a new Pixel phone, Amazon, Google and other retailers will discount the Google Pixel 9 series again, especially as we inch closer to the Pixel 10 release this summer. Update Friday 11th April: Google has officially launched the Pixel 9a and with it a slew of new promotions. First up, the Search company is giving away a $100 store credit with Pixel 9a purchases. Crucially, this can’t be used on the handset itself, rather towards your next buy. Buyers can pick up the Pixel Buds A-series for $99, which is clearly the intention behind that offer. As we have seen before with Samsung, budget wearables are a good makeweight in deals like this. Google has also upped its trade-in prices for your old phone. The company says you can pick up the Pixel 9a for as little as $99 with the right trade-in. That, of course, means handing over a Pixel 8 Pro, or Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. You can get the new phone for free if you swap in the original Pixel Fold or iPhone 15 Pro Max. A slightly more realistic trade-in is the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is worth $405, but that still feels like a downgrade to me. None of these phones should be traded in for the Pixel 9a. More sensical deals include $200 for the Pixel 7a, $280 for the iPhone 14 and $180 for the Pixel 6 Pro.

This ruling concludes a five-year legal battle initiated by Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, which challenged Apple's dominance in the digital app marketplace.  Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, presiding over the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, found that Apple willfully violated a previous court order designed to open the App Store to greater competition. The federal judge's ruling delivered a sharp and unmistakable rebuke to Apple, making clear her frustration with the company's repeated defiance of court orders. Judge Rogers criticized Apple's response to her earlier injunction, which had directed the company to allow developers to steer users to external payment options, bypassing Apple's standard 30 percent commission. Instead of complying, Apple implemented a new system that required apps using external payment links to pay a 27 percent commission. The company also introduced pop-up warnings to discourage users from making payments outside the App Store, suggesting such transactions might not be secure. Judge Rogers wrote, ""Apple aimed to sustain a revenue stream worth billions in blatant violation of this court's injunction."" We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.

Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv The judge's frustration was evident. She accused Apple executives of dishonesty, specifically naming Alex Roman, Apple's Vice President of Finance, for ""outright lying"" to the court about when the company decided to impose the new 27 percent fee. Judge Rogers stated that neither Apple nor its legal team corrected what she called ""obvious lies,"" and she referred the matter to federal prosecutors to consider criminal contempt charges against both Roman and the company. She also criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook, saying, ""Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option."" The ruling prohibits Apple from collecting commissions on sales made outside the App Store and from enacting policies preventing developers from directing users to external payment methods. Apple is also forbidden from displaying messages that might dissuade users from purchasing outside its platform. Judge Rogers emphasized, ""Apple will not impede competition"" and that ""the court will not tolerate further delays."" The outcome not only signals a major victory for Epic Games but also opens the door for sweeping changes in how developers and consumers interact with the digital marketplace.  Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney welcomed the decision, stating, ""There will be considerable opportunities for developers to secure better deals and for consumers to benefit as well. This is a fantastic day for everyone involved."" Apple expressed strong disagreement with the ruling. ""We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order, and we will appeal,"" said Apple spokeswoman Olivia Dalton. The legal saga began in 2020, when Epic Games accused Apple of stifling competition by forcing developers to use its payment system and taking up to a 30 percent cut of many transactions. The App Store is a major revenue source for Apple, accounting for a significant portion of its nearly $100 billion in annual services revenue. While Apple initially avoided being labeled a monopoly, the court found it had violated California's competition laws by blocking alternative payment options for developers. Wednesday's ruling is expected to reshape the app economy, potentially allowing developers to retain more earnings and reducing fees that have long flowed to Apple. The decision also paves the way for Fortnite's return to the iOS App Store in the United States, after being removed in 2020 when Epic enabled alternative payment methods within the game. As the dust settles, Judge Rogers left the door open for further action, stating, ""It will be up to the executive branch to determine if Apple should face consequences for its violations, in addition to any penalties aimed at preventing future misconduct.""

The App Store is a major revenue source for Apple, accounting for a significant portion of its nearly $100 billion in annual services revenue. While Apple initially avoided being labeled a monopoly, the court found it had violated California's competition laws by blocking alternative payment options for developers. Wednesday's ruling is expected to reshape the app economy, potentially allowing developers to retain more earnings and reducing fees that have long flowed to Apple. The decision also paves the way for Fortnite's return to the iOS App Store in the United States, after being removed in 2020 when Epic enabled alternative payment methods within the game. As the dust settles, Judge Rogers left the door open for further action, stating, ""It will be up to the executive branch to determine if Apple should face consequences for its violations, in addition to any penalties aimed at preventing future misconduct.""

 If you live outside the United States, lobbying with the government and politicians is often known as a form of corruption, and it might become a big scandal if it gets exposed to the media. However, in the United States, lobbying with the government and lawmakers is actually legal. There are even companies and individuals who can willingly do that for you in exchange for a sum of money. Companies, particularly those in the tech industry, engage in lobbying to safeguard their interests and ensure that upcoming legislation aligns with their business goals. The scale of lobbying by these tech giants is significant, with substantial amounts of money being invested in these efforts. OpenSecrets, a website that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, has published detailed reports about lobbying efforts by some Big Tech firms. Let’s see how much these giant tech firms have spent on lobbying in 2024: Apple Inc: Meta: Microsoft Corp:  Amazon:  OpenAI: Alphabet Inc: Samsung Group: What do you think about corporations lobbying the government? Should this process be made illegal?

In this episode, we dive into the rising financial pressures facing working parents today. From the skyrocketing costs of childcare, school supplies, summer camps, and college tuition to the everyday expenses of raising a family – the financial burden has never been higher.  We speak with Kendra Cole, a PR professional and mother of three, about the crippling costs of summer camps across the U.S., with families shelling out thousands of dollars just to cover the school summer vacation.  Meanwhile, wages haven’t kept pace with inflation, leaving many parents stretched thin as they try to provide stability for their children. In 2023, the national average price of care for one child in the U.S. was $11,582 which averages out to $965 per month. For families with more than one child, that can be more than their rent or mortgage payment. We speak with MarketWatch personal finance reporter Venessa Wong on how parents are going into credit card debt to cover costs. And how she herself feels the pressure to start saving for her kids’ college education before they reach high school.  Many people have pushed back on returning to the office for more days because they’ve molded their work and personal lives around a more hybrid, flexible schedule for the last 5 years. Some employers are assisting with that transition better than others. Companies like Walmart, P&G and Cisco offer on-site childcare at some offices and back-up childcare services for working parents.
