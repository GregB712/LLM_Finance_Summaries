    "content": "Way back in 2021, in the Epic v. Apple court case, judge US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to allow third-party developers to tell users how to make payments inside iOS applications without going through Apple’s App Store. As we have come to expect from Apple, the company maliciously complied, lowering the commission on purchases outside of its ecosystem from 30% to 27%, while also adding a whole bunch of hoops and hurdles, like scare screens with doom-and-gloom language to, well, scare consumers into staying within Apple’s ecosystem for in-app payments. Well, it turns out Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is furious, giving Apple, Tim Cook, and its other executives what can only be described as a beatdown – even highlighting how one of Apple’s executives, under orders from Tim Cook, lied under oath several times. Gonzalez is referring this to the District Attorney for Northern California “to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.” In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein, more than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a violation. The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. Gonzalez’ entire ruling is scathing, seething with rage, and will probably do more reputational damage to Apple, Tim Cook, and his executive team than any bendgate or antennagate could ever do. Judge Gonzalez: This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases. Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court’s Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the cover-up made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple. Gonzalez effectively destroyed any ability for Apple to charge commissions on purchases made inside iOS applications but outside Apple’s App Store, and this order will definitely find its way to the European Union as well, where it will serve as further evidence of Tim Cook’s and Apple’s continuous, never-ending contempt for the law and courts that uphold it. For its part, Apple has stated they’re going to appeal. Good luck with that.  Follow me on Mastodon @[email protected] You must be logged in to post a comment. Help keep OSNews alive!",

Hi Tim, Just wanted to comment on the quote you have on today’s 5 Bullet Friday. This may come off as a too pessimistic of a perspective, and I guess Buckingham gives this insight as a part of a broader context that is cohesive and sensible, but I want to share my first thought nevertheless: Finding the most generous explanation for the other’s behavior each time and believing it will bring a collossal misery and grief if the other person is a gaslighter with narcissistic tendencies. I’d humbly say the key is getting to know the person in one’s personal, and business, relationships in a realistic way, which is not an easy feat. Just my two cents. Great conversation!  Interesting tidbit that Rich Barton’s reference for what he would put on a billboard “Don’t Panic” was attributed to a movie starring Eddie Murphy  but, in fact, originally appears as the cover of the fictional book “Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy” that was in the real book by Douglas Murray also titled “Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy”.   Anybody else notice this? I was also curious if Rich had read this book and knew the reference as he is a science fiction fan? It always seems to be the guys who have grown up with some element of privilege, made all the right decisions, had a solid support system, experienced no childhood abuse, or adolescent self-inflicted trauma, and subsequently have blinders on about the experiences of others who tend to spout this quasi-birther propaganda. Barton is very likeable in most ways, the rest of the interview was engaging and educational, but no, we don’t all need to have children, and I say this as a mother. Of course, there are benefits like ‘ego shedding’ as I think he said, and other ways we grow because of our kids. Still, when we didn’t grow up supported in that way, or have faced unique challenges, when our mental health isn’t super stable all the time, parenting can be brutal as well, and ends up being an equal 50/50 benefit-to-obstacle ratio. Kids trigger every trauma response inside us, over and over, 24/7, which, yes, encourages us to grow, but can also take its toll in debilitating ways, and toss up huge roadblocks on our life’s path, especially when we feel like we have a purpose to pursue outside of parenting. This is, of course, more true for women who give up careers for our kids. Barton references this as an issue of the past, but again, he’s speaking from a position of privilege. Money and opportunity make all obstacles smaller. (Then tenfold again for women who gave up our careers then find ourselves divorced). If Tim happens to read this… I’m so tired of hearing privileged men tell you that you need to have this experience. The purpose you have found on your life’s path is much larger than parenting, you’ve helped millions of adults find our way in the world, in ways our own parents never did. You’d make a wonderful father, but you’re already a wonderful human in ways that surpass the need to take that path. You’re on the right path for you, more so than most people you interview, you will find the partner you can trust and grow old with, and regardless of whether children are part of that journey, you will have lived an ambitiously pursued and perfectly fulfilled life when all is said and done. <3 “Don’t panic” is the inscription on the cover of the fictional book “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” by Douglas Adams.

    "description": "An AI-infused version of the Siri digital assistant, promised as part of the Apple Intelligence suite, should be ready to launch this fall.",
    "content": "An AI-infused version of the Siri digital assistant, promised as part of the Apple Intelligence features previewed in July 2024, should be ready to launch this fall. Apple has fumbled Siri’s AI makeover so badly that it had no choice but delay the promised features, publicly admitting an AI version of the assistant would arrive “in the coming year.” The vague statement left us speculating whether the company was aiming to release an AI-infused Siri publicly this fall fall alongside iOS 19 or later in 2025 via updates to iOS 19 or as part of iOS 20 in the fall of 2026. The New York Times now says the revamped Siri is coming this fall. It doesn’t specify whether the assistant would be included in the initial iOS 19.0 release in September or a point update like iOS 19.1 later in the fall. “Apple hasn’t canceled its revamped Siri. The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said,” reads the piece. Tripp Mickle at The New York Times: The company’s issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers. The albatross comparisons sounds apt. And company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers. Penny pinching came into light in early 2023, when Apple’s AI chief John Giannandrea wanted to buy more Nvidia chips for AI training. At the time, Apple’s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old. In comparison, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta had purchased hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Cook approved doubling the AI team’s chip budget, but finance chief Luca Maestri got in the way, reducing the increase to less than half that. HE reportedly “encouraged the team” to make the chips they had “more efficient.” If that’s not penny pinching, I don’t know what is. The lack of GPUs meant the team developing AI systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its AI development. On political infighting: At the same time, leaders at two of Apple’s software teams were battling over who would spearhead the rollout of Siri’s new abilities, three people who worked on the effort said. Robby Walker, who oversaw Siri, and Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a senior executive with the software team, struggled over who would have responsibility for some aspects of the project. Both ended up with pieces of the project. On talent drain: In 2019, Jony Ive, the company’s chief designer, left to start his own design firm and poached more than a dozen integral Apple designers and engineers. And Dan Riccio, the company’s longtime head of product design who sworked on the Apple Watch, retired last year. So far, the Siri makeover has included a glow animation around the edges when invoking the assistant, the ability to tap into Apple’s support articles to provide product knowledge and an integration with ChatGPT. The delayed features include awareness of the user’s personal content (“When’s Mom’s flight arriving?”) and taking complex actions across apps on your behalf. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple’s leadership revealed in an all-hands meeting following the announcement of the Siri delay that internal testing had found that an AI-infused Siri was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests. Apple has suffered a significant blow to its reputation over the Siri delay, resulting in a reshuffling among its executive ranks. The Siri team is now under the leadership of Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi, with Mike Rockwell, the head of its Vision Pro headset, charged with leading the project instead of John Giannandrea. The Information recently reported that much of Apple’s problems with Siri stem from poor leadership. Unnamed employees told the publication that Robby Walker, the former executive in charge of AI upgrades to Siri, lacks “both ambition and an appetite for taking risks” on designing future versions of the voice assistant. Among engineers inside Apple, the AI group’s relaxed culture and struggles with execution have even earned it an uncharitable nickname, a play on its initials: AIMLess. Ouch! The article also claims that the Siri demo where the assistant is asked about an executive mom’s flight landing and lunch plans was choreographed, and that the only feature ready for testing was the new Siri glow animation: Among members of the Siri team at Apple, though, the demonstration was a surprise. They had never seen working versions of the capabilities, according to a former Apple employee. At the time, the only new feature from the demonstration that was activated for test devices was a pulsing, colorful ribbon that appeared on the edges of the iPhone’s screen when a user invoked Siri, the former employee said. Software chief Craig Federighi has reportedly built his own AI division, dubbed Intelligent Systems, as part of the reshuffling. Meanwhile, John Giannandrea is now apparently solely focused on Apple’s research in the AI and ML fields. Most importantly, Federighi is said to have changed Apple’s policy to permit the use of third-party AI models to build new Siri features.

    "clean_content": "An AI-infused version of the Siri digital assistant, promised as part of the Apple Intelligence features previewed in July 2024, should be ready to launch this fall. Apple has fumbled Siri’s AI makeover so badly that it had no choice but delay the promised features, publicly admitting an AI version of the assistant would arrive “in the coming year.” The vague statement left us speculating whether the company was aiming to release an AI-infused Siri publicly this fall fall alongside iOS 19 or later in 2025 via updates to iOS 19 or as part of iOS 20 in the fall of 2026. The New York Times now says the revamped Siri is coming this fall. It doesn’t specify whether the assistant would be included in the initial iOS 19.0 release in September or a point update like iOS 19.1 later in the fall. “Apple hasn’t canceled its revamped Siri. The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said,” reads the piece. Tripp Mickle at The New York Times: The company’s issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers. The albatross comparisons sounds apt. And company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers. Penny pinching came into light in early 2023, when Apple’s AI chief John Giannandrea wanted to buy more Nvidia chips for AI training. At the time, Apple’s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old. In comparison, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta had purchased hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Cook approved doubling the AI team’s chip budget, but finance chief Luca Maestri got in the way, reducing the increase to less than half that. HE reportedly “encouraged the team” to make the chips they had “more efficient.” If that’s not penny pinching, I don’t know what is. The lack of GPUs meant the team developing AI systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its AI development. On political infighting: At the same time, leaders at two of Apple’s software teams were battling over who would spearhead the rollout of Siri’s new abilities, three people who worked on the effort said. Robby Walker, who oversaw Siri, and Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a senior executive with the software team, struggled over who would have responsibility for some aspects of the project. Both ended up with pieces of the project. On talent drain: In 2019, Jony Ive, the company’s chief designer, left to start his own design firm and poached more than a dozen integral Apple designers and engineers.

Deadline first reported the project. “The Riders” follows Fred Scully (Pitt), who, after traveling Europe with his wife, Jennifer, and seven-year-old daughter, Billie, purchases a farmhouse in rural Ireland. Jennifer and Billie then return to Australia to finalize their affairs, only for Billie to return to Ireland alone after traveling across the globe, with Jennifer now missing.

A24 will finance and distribute the film worldwide.  Production will commence in early 2026 and shoot in multiple locations across Europe. In the meantime, Pitt will lead the “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” sequel for Netflix, reportedly titled “The Continuing Adventures of Cliff Booth.” David Fincher will direct from a script by Quentin Tarantino. Pitt also leads Joseph Kosinski’s upcoming race drama “F1,” out in June 2025. Berger already has another Netflix film in the works, following the Oscar-winning success of “All Quiet on the Western Front,” with “The Ballad of a Small Player,” led by Colin Farrell. Tilda Swinton co-stars in the con artist drama based on Rowan Joffé’s novel, though a release date or festival berth has not yet been set. Production wrapped in August 2024. Producer Scott has a slew of projects in the works, including the adaptation of the novel “The Dog Stars” with Jacob Elordi, who replaced Paul Mescal.

    "content": "A judge in the United States has ruled that Apple’s 15-30 percent commission fee on purchases made outside the App Store apps is anti-competitive and must stop. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers just killed Apple’s anti-steering rule in the Epic Games v. Apple case, saying Apple cannot charge a 15-30 percent commission fee on purchases that iPhone owners make outside the App Store apps. As a result, third-party developers can now accept web payments without paying Apple fees. Apple charges a commission on all payments made through its In-App Purchase mechanism, which provides seamless billing and a number of other benefits. The main point of contention between third-party developers like Epic Games and Apple has been external purchases made on the web, like V-Bucks for Fortnite. Apple thinks it’s entitled to a cut on web purchases, but the judge called it anticompetitive behavior, slamming the company for “willfully” avoiding to comply with the previous injunction from the original 2021 ruling. “That [Apple] thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,” the judge said. The original ruling said Apple must permit developers to inform users about alternative payments that are available externally, on the web. Instead of complying with the ruling, Apple created a new policy demanding that developers instead pay a 27 percent fee on such purchases. However, the judge called out Apple’s behavior in today’s ruling, accusing the firm of trying to “maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this court’s injunction.” She added that Phil Schiller, who runs the App Store, advised Apple CEO Tim Cook to comply with her 2021 decision, but that Apple’s boss “chose poorly” by letting finance chief Luca Maestri “convince him otherwise.” For further information, check out Techmeme’s roundup of news coverage and commentary. NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple’s 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there. 4 years 4 months 17 days. https://t.co/RucrsX7Z4A pic.twitter.com/3kSYnt5pcI — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) April 30, 2025  The 80-page ruling explicitly prohibits Apple from charging any commission fee on purchases made outside an app. Apple also imposed heavy restrictions on how third-party developers inform people within apps that other payment options are available on the web. Those restrictions are gone now, too, as the ruling prohibits Apple from blocking or limiting the use of such buttons or other calls to action. Moreover, Apple is barred from restricting developers’ style, formatting or placement of links for purchases outside of an app. And when you decide to click a button to make a purchase outside of an app, Apple cannot throw up any scare screens; according to the ruling, the only messaging allowed here is “a neutral message apprising users that they are going to a third-party site.” Companies specializing in web and in-app payments like RevenueCat have already seized the opportunity, so RevenueCat just announced that developers can now use its Paywalls service to point customers to the web for checkout. The screenshots RevenueCat shared illustrate why the judge’s ruling is going to cost Apple dearly: the in-app buttons and the wording make it perfectly clear that you can buy the same subscription on the web up to thirty percent cheaper. Thirty percent is nothing to sneeze at, especially in an economy like this. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney announced on X that Fortnite is returning to the App Store in the United States as early as “next week.” He also floated a peace proposal to the iPhone maker, saying that “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.” Fortnite is available as a direct download on iPhone in the European Union as of February 2024 due to Apple’s compliance with the Digital Markets Act.

The screenshots RevenueCat shared illustrate why the judge’s ruling is going to cost Apple dearly: the in-app buttons and the wording make it perfectly clear that you can buy the same subscription on the web up to thirty percent cheaper. Thirty percent is nothing to sneeze at, especially in an economy like this. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney announced on X that Fortnite is returning to the App Store in the United States as early as “next week.” He also floated a peace proposal to the iPhone maker, saying that “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.” Fortnite is available as a direct download on iPhone in the European Union as of February 2024 due to Apple’s compliance with the Digital Markets Act.

    "content": "BySindhya Valloppillil  BySindhya Valloppillil, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder & CEO of Skin Dossier BySindhya Valloppillil,  Contributor.  The Badass Workshop by Bozoma Saint John.  While many celebrities and public figures such as Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jessica Alba raised venture capital to launch their brands, Bozoma Saint John didn’t – instead, she flexed. She self-funded her Eve by Boz, a luxury wig, extensions, and hair care brand, with several million of her own hard-earned money. Indeed not everyone has that kind of personal capital to launch a brand; however, even when they do have that kind of money, they don’t invest in themselves. Saint John’s investment in her own brand is the ultimate flex, especially considering the systemic racism that diverse founders deal with, particularly Black female founders. Ahead of going on stage at SXSW, Shark Tank billionaire and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban took some time to give advice to Black female founders in a talk with Essence magazine, telling them to stop looking for funding. “I would tell you not to look for funding,” the shark said. “You have to figure out a way to use sweat equity to build it on your own, even if it means starting smaller and slower, because there is a learning process, and it’s twofold. One is learning about your business and making it loan-worthy. Then, two is learning the language of those making the loans.” Cuban, like many early-stage VCs, espouses a very presumptuous and belittling opinion of Black female founders, presuming that they don’t know the language of business, venture, or finance and that they need to start at the remedial basics. Due to the systemic bias of VCs, “less than 1% of venture funding is going to diverse audiences, and even less than that to Black female founders.” ____________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________ Despite the viability of their businesses and the large TAM, Black founders say there is waning interest in their brands from the financial community. VCs don’t always recognize the broad appeal or viability of their businesses or appreciate the problems that they are solving. While many female founders have raised millions at the idea stage for their beauty brands, Black female founders have difficulty raising capital even when they have purchase orders from major retailers. Black female founders carry a markedly higher burden when it comes to educating investors on the value and viability of their business ideas. The share of U.S. startup funding going to companies with Black founders hit a multi-year low in 2024, even as overall funding ticked slightly higher. Only around $730 million — or 0.4% of all funding — went to startups with a Black founder or co-founder last year, per Crunchbase. That’s the lowest share in years, down over two-thirds from just three years ago. At the same time, the dichotomy is that black consumers’ beauty spending is exceeding not only other demographic groups but also the industry overall in the U.S. According to NeilsenIQ, Black consumer spend in beauty hit $10.2 billion in 2023. \"I didn’t take a dollar from anyone to build this brand. I put my money into this business and every bit of stock I got from the companies I've worked at because I believe in Eve by Boz. So, yes, I want this business to be successful, but more than that, I want people to recognize our buying power matters. I'm going to show the world that it's possible to build an empire with Black women and women of color at the center,\" said Saint John in an interview with Byrdie. Uber Chief Brand Officer Bozoma Saint John (L) and TechCrunch moderator Megan Rose Dickey speak ... More onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017 Bozoma Saint John is not the average founder. She has had an illustrious career as the former CMO of Netflix; Chief Marketing Officer at Endeavor; Chief Brand Officer at Uber; Head of Global Marketing at Beats by Dre, iTunes, and Apple Music; and Head of Music and Entertainment Marketing at Pepsi. Before Pepsi, Saint John was a Senior Account Executive at SpikeDDB, Spike Lee’s ad agency, where she started as a temp. She was named Billboard’s Female Executive of the Year, the #1 spot on Forbes' World's Most Influential CMOs list in 2021, and was inducted into the Marketing Hall of Fame in 2022. Although she didn’t go to business school, Harvard Business School published a case study about Saint John’s achievements titled \"Bozoma Saint John: Leading with Authenticity and Urgency.\" After the popularity of the case study, Saint John developed and taught 3 SIP (Short Intensive Program) classes at the University aptly named \"The Anatomy of a Badass\" based on the case study. Additionally, Stanford GSB’s Dean’s premier speaker series, “View From The Top,” profiled her. When Saint John left Apple to join Uber during the #DeleteUber movement, people asked her why. She replied that she wanted to be “recognized for my influence in tech, because I knew that if I could turn around the brand perception, no one could assign my success to anyone else.” She replied that she wanted to be “recognized for my influence in tech, because I knew that if I could turn around the brand perception, no one could assign my success to anyone else.” She told Travis Kalanick that she wanted to be the face of Uber, and she was featured on 20 magazine covers and did 400 interviews. “Companies get a lot of airtime for hiring someone like me. So if I’m out in front, I don’t know why in the hell you’re complaining. And by the way, you are very welcome that I’m able to get in front of an audience and they say, ‘You know what? We trust her, and so, therefore, we’ll trust you.’ That was one of the biggest things that I brought to Uber,” she said. Saint John branded herself Badass Boz and launched The Badass Workshop to share her wisdom and help others become the best version of themselves. Although the workshop started as an online workshop, she took it on a multi-city tour with a sold-out attendance in Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, Accra, Toronto, London, and Lagos. The workshop was recently featured on an episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. More recently, Saint John joined the cast of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 14. When asked why she joined, she said, “No linear answer to why I joined RHOBH. That’s not how my decisions are made. Mine are made by intuition. I’ve been in many rooms and disrupted the space because, among many other identities, I am Black, a woman, and I have really brilliant ideas. I’ve never been intimidated by spaces that maybe other people didn’t think I should be in.” She added, “I’m here to disrupt it.” She is a fan favorite on the show. ____________________________________________________________ She added, “I saw a bigger opportunity. So I thought, why not? Maybe they need some more corporate baddies, some self-made women on this platform. I think they do.” ____________________________________________________________ Moreover, Saint John is aware of how entertainment offers an opportunity for representation. She said, “I think that entertainment has a very, very, very big role in changing societal norms. If we are able to use entertainment to normalize experiences across the board, then we have a much better shot at being just better human beings.” She added, \"I saw a bigger opportunity. So I thought, why not? Maybe they need some more corporate baddies, some self-made women on this platform. I think they do.\" Saint John also mentioned how content can spark curiosity and connection. Her tagline on the show’s introduction is “Introducing the greatest product I’ve ever marketed… myself.” She built a very engaged following on social media that has grown exponentially since she joined RHBH, which is great for her brand Eve by Boz. In addition to wearing Eve by Boz wigs and extensions, Saint John made an intentional choice to exclusively wear Black designers from head to toe for every episode – that is the statement she wants to make. More importantly, it’s her contribution to uplift and bring more recognition to Black designers. Promotional image for Eve by Boz.  Eve by Boz isn’t a vanity project for Saint John. She is a passionate domain expert. Previously, Saint John partnered with Dove, the CROWN Coalition, and LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network, to launch #BlackHairIsProfessional, a campaign to make a systemic impact, create more inclusive and equitable spaces for Black women to don natural hairstyles prevalent in the Black community in the workplace. Ahead of launching Eve by Boz, she went to Guangzhou, China, to research the hair manufacturing process and attended the largest hair show in the world while there. “I asked one vendor, ‘Why is the lace always white?' They said, 'Because nobody asked us for anything else.' While there, I saw it was possible to achieve different lace colors and textures. That's what really opened this door for me and made me want to create something intentional for us.\" Saint John wanted to create a luxury product experience for Eve by Boz, so the website features photos of beautiful models, including videos that highlight how the hair moves. The wigs and extensions are packaged in bonnets made by Ghana Textiles, the country’s oldest textile company. She also realized she needed haircare products, so she worked with a Black chemist, Gerri Watson, to create the haircare line to increase the longevity of the wigs and extensions. Promotional imagery for Eve by Boz Saint John’s impact extends beyond conventional business achievements and her startup; she’s creating a path for others to see what’s possible when you break through barriers (like systemic bias in venture capital), particularly as a Black woman in underrepresented spaces. Her unique blend of vision, strategy, and cultural insight speaks volumes. She’s not just building a business without a safety net; she’s establishing a legacy — demonstrating that resilience, innovation, and unapologetic authenticity can lead to something truly iconic. Her journey is a powerful reminder that success is measured not just by numbers but by the impact, influence, and inspiration it sparks in others to pursue their paths confidently.",

Here’s how it works.\n Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is still far from getting everything he originally wanted from his war over iOS app store payments, but he just won a huge victory as a US court has bodied Apple for violating a 2021 injunction, going so far as to refer the iPhone maker's behavior to criminal prosecutors. When Epic started its war with Apple, it wanted to use its own payment processing system in Fortnite on iOS, bypassing Apple's 30% fee. Epic lost that battle in a 2021 trial, but the US courts ruled in its favor on one point: Apple was told it couldn't stop iOS app developers from directing users to out-of-app websites that use their own payment processors. Since then, Sweeney has been complaining that Apple has not truly complied with the court's will, and after reviewing the evidence, the court has come down firmly on Sweeney's side. \"Apple's response to the Injunction strains credulity,\" reads today's order from judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. \"After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction's goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream.\" \"We strongly disagree with the decision,\" an Apple spokesperson told PC Gamer in response to a request for comment. \"We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\" Instead of simply allowing developers to link to out-of-app payment systems in response to the original injunction, Apple introduced a 27% commission on those out-of-app payments. Apple also added \"scare\" screens that seemed to warn users away from out-of-app purchases, something Sweeney has also complained about with regard to Apple's compliance with a related European law. Epic did not think Apple was truly abiding by the injunction, and an evidentiary hearing took place in 2024 to look into it. According to today's order, the court became concerned that Apple was not being entirely truthful about how it came up with that 27% fee, and told it to produce documents related to its injunction compliance planning. Apple stalled, but a second hearing took place earlier this year, and the court did not like what it saw. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up\" in 2024's hearing, wrote the district judge, who also stated that Apple VP of finance Alex Roman \"outright lied under oath\"—a matter she has referred to the regional US attorneys office \"to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\" Roman's testimony was \"replete with misdirection and outright lies,\" said the judge. For instance, he testified that Apple had not considered the external payment processing costs developers would also be paying when it came up with its 27% commission for out-of-app purchases. Evidence revealed to the court showed that Apple was aware of those costs, \"which conveniently exceeded the 3% discount Apple ultimately decided to provide by a safe margin.\" And the fee itself was a violation of the injunction. According to the court, Apple executive Phil Schiller understood this and opposed the fee, but \"Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.\" \"Cook chose poorly,\" wrote the judge. Following today's order, Apple will have no more leeway unless it succeeds in its appeal: There will be no more fees for out-of-app iOS purchases in the US, not just for Epic, but for any developer. \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation,\" reads the order. \"There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.\" We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. https://t.co/bIRTePm0TvApril 30, 2025 Sweeney still hasn't gotten what he originally wanted—the ability to include his own payment processor directly in the app—but that hasn't been on the table in the US since that original 2021 ruling. After this victory, he says he's ready for peace. \"We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week,\" Sweeney tweeted today. \"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.\" Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

    "content": "May 1, 2025 8:27 AM PT U.S. District Court judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled largely in Apple’s favor in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit back in 2021, but she did find that Apple’s requirement that apps only use Apple’s payment methods and not link to external methods was fundamentally anticompetitive. So she ordered Apple to change its behavior. After two failed appeals, Apple was forced to follow her orders. In a judgment handed out on Wednesday, Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple acted in contempt by failing to follow her orders and scheming to find ways to avoid them, that at least one executive lied under oath, and concluded that Apple has so brazenly botched the aftermath of her order that several of its longstanding App Store policies are now entirely void. It was a bad day in court for Apple. And a self-inflicted one. As Gonzalez Rogers writes in her finding: \n  Apple’s response to the Injunction strains credulity. After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction’s goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream. Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up.\n What the judge found back in 2021 was that Apple’s 30 percent cut of App Store in-app purchases was fundamentally uncompetitive, as was Apple’s rule that prevented app developers from pointing users to external purchase options on the web. She ordered that Apple change its behavior, but instead Apple did pretty much what we all imagined they had done: cook up a scheme that seemed to follow the order but made the result so unpalatable that developers would opt for the status quo instead. Thanks to the power of the subpoena, Gonzalez Rogers has brought receipts. There’s a large document trail indicating that Apple reverse engineered a 27% commission for external transactions (including a lengthy post-referral royalty period) in order to make them no better than just using Apple’s own internal payment system. When a major app developer pointed out that the overhead of external payment systems was more than the commonly-cited 3% (meaning that the entire thing would be a net money loser), Apple celebrated the good news. Apple also attempted to engineer the directive to allow external links in apps by creating new barriers and requirements that would similarly defang those orders. It created full-page “scare screens” (I referred to them as “This App May Kill You” screens), demanded that all links be to static URLs (neutering their utility), and kept editing the warning labels to dissuade users as much as possible from ever agreeing to follow the link. (Cook is specifically credited with amping up the language in the warning screens.) The company’s internal struggle is fascinating to read about. While Apple Fellow and longtime App Store overseer Phil Schiller doesn’t come across entirely smelling like a rose, he does end up looking far better than literally any other Apple employee in the ruling. Schiller “advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction”—imagine that!—while Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, and the company’s finance team instead decided to concoct a strategy of malicious compliance that led to the poison pill of the 27% commission. “Cook chose poorly,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote. Not only did Apple attempt to find ways to circumvent the injunction, but it fatally hid their discussions from the judge. While Schiller gets credit from Gonzalez Rogers for sitting through the trial and reading the final decision1, the judge suggests that his colleagues at Apple did not. Most troubling is the behavior of Apple’s Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, who the judge says “outright lied under oath” multiple times. She referred her ruling to the U.S. Attorney’s office in San Francisco for possible criminal prosecution of Apple generally and Roman specifically. “At every step Apple considered whether its actions would comply, and at every step Apple chose to maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream over compliance,” she wrote. Because Apple has proven itself untrustworthy, the judge has decided that the time for talk is over. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation,” she wrote Wednesday. “There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.” As a result, she has now enjoined Apple entirely from impeding the ability of developers to communicate with users or charging a commission for external transactions. In other words, Apple had its chance to comply, but since it refused to do so reasonably, it’s going to get hammered. In the least surprising response possible, Apple says it will appeal. Maybe this time it’ll take things a bit more seriously. If you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

Epic has announced that starting June 2025, all payments processed via the Epic Games Store will pay a zero percent revenue share to the company until they reach $1 million in revenue. After that, Epic's usual 88%-12% split will kick in. It all started when Apple faced a setback in 2021 when the court ruled against it and said that it cannot restrict app developers from including buttons, external links, or other call-to-actions within their apps to direct customers to external payment systems. However, Apple did not make the necessary changes even in 2025, which compelled Epic to return to the court. On April 30, 2025, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled in the District Court for the Northern District of California that Apple \"willfully chose not to comply with this Court’s Injunction\" and that it did so with \"the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers\". The judge also ruled that Apple's Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, lied under oath about implementing a 27% commission fee on purchases made outside of the App Store in January 2024. However, documents revealed that this decision was actually made in July 2023. Now that external payments are coming, Epic is also finally bringing Fortnite to the U.S. App Store on iOS devices. The company also says that it will release a new feature that will allow developers to launch their own \"webshops,\" which will be hosted on the Epic Games Store. These webshops can offer players out-of-app purchases, as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees. With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States. Players who purchase their items via Epic Webshops will also accrue 5% Epic Rewards on all purchases.  \n\nJohn Callaham\n                                                ·\n                    \nJul 7, 2024\n\nwith\n7\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n \n\nJohn Callaham\n                                                ·\n                    \nMar 8, 2024\n\nwith\n9\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n \n\nJohn Callaham\n                                                ·\n                    \nMar 6, 2024\n\nwith\n18\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n \n\nJohn Callaham\n                                                ·\n                    \nJan 25, 2024\n\nwith\n20\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n Login or Sign Up to read and post a comment.

EDT Apr 16, 2025 | 4:32 PM EDT Rogers has a new deal hidden in its fine print that can help you save some money on a smartwatch or a tablet with a data plan for two years. To take advantage of the deal, you need to get a specific Rogers ‘Infinite’ plan and finance a tablet or smartwatch from the carrier. The $60/150 GB plan is the cheapest option, so I’d recommend it. It includes Canada/U.S. data, as well as 1,000 long-distance minutes and all the other standard smartphone plan features. There are ‘Infinite’ plans with lower prices, but they don’t include the smartwatch/tablet bill credits.  Then you need to decide if you want to finance a tablet or a smartwatch. Right now Rogers has the Apple Watch Series 10 (alumnium) down to $20 per month. The Galaxy Watch 7 is also this price, but most of the others are more expensive. The tablets are more expensive, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE down to $31 per month on finacing. iPads are even more costly. To be clear, the smartwatch or tablet you add to the plan is not free. You still need to finance the device over 24 months, but once you start, you can connect your new device to your smartphone plan for free and use your mobile data without a hotspot. Typically, this would cost $15 per month, so Rogers waives that $15 fee with this deal. Rogers’ fine print says, “This offer is available to customers activating a new line, completing a Price Plan Change or performing a hardware upgrade on non-discounted, consumer, in-market, Infinite Extra plan or above.” Source: Rogers MobileSyrup may earn a commission from purchases made via our links, which helps fund the journalism we provide free on our website.

EDT Apr 16, 2025 | 4:32 PM EDT Rogers has a new deal hidden in its fine print that can help you save some money on a smartwatch or a tablet with a data plan for two years. To take advantage of the deal, you need to get a specific Rogers ‘Infinite’ plan and finance a tablet or smartwatch from the carrier. The $60/150 GB plan is the cheapest option, so I’d recommend it. It includes Canada/U.S. data, as well as 1,000 long-distance minutes and all the other standard smartphone plan features. There are ‘Infinite’ plans with lower prices, but they don’t include the smartwatch/tablet bill credits. Then you need to decide if you want to finance a tablet or a smartwatch. Right now Rogers has the Apple Watch Series 10  down to $20 per month. The Galaxy Watch 7 is also this price, but most of the others are more expensive. The tablets are more expensive, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE down to $31 per month on finacing. iPads are even more costly. To be clear, the smartwatch or tablet you add to the plan is not free. You still need to finance the device over 24 months, but once you start, you can connect your new device to your smartphone plan for free and use your mobile data without a hotspot. Typically, this would cost $15 per month, so Rogers waives that $15 fee with this deal. Rogers’ fine print says, “This offer is available to customers activating a new line, completing a Price Plan Change or performing a hardware upgrade on non-discounted, consumer, in-market, Infinite Extra plan or above.” Source: Rogers MobileSyrup may earn a commission from purchases made via our links, which helps fund the journalism we provide free on our website.

    "content": "ByDanielle Chemtob  andForbes Daily  ByDanielle Chemtob,  Forbes Staff  andForbes Daily,  Forbes Staff.  President Donald Trump appears to be softening on his steep China tariffs, and his shifting whims once again moved markets. Trump indicated his 145% levies on Chinese goods would “come down substantially,” and markets got a further boost after the Wall Street Journal reported the Trump Administration intends to slash the import taxes by more than half. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Wednesday at a 1.1% gain, the S&P 500 received a 1.7% boost, and the Nasdaq increased 2.5%. But Chinese officials on Thursday said that any claims of progress in trade talks between China and the U.S. were “groundless and have no factual basis,” while reiterating its stance that the Trump Administration must drop all unilateral tariffs against the country. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in 2022. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s fortune grew by $7.5 billion Wednesday, despite the EV maker reporting abysmal quarterly results, as Musk indicated he would recommit to the company and scale back his White House role. The comments were music to the ears of investors and analysts concerned about Musk’s outspoken politics and time spent at DOGE. Evercore ISI analysts described the Tesla chief’s tone on the earnings call as “Mea culpa Elon.” The European Union fined Apple and Meta $570 million and $228 million, respectively, after a year-long investigation into the companies’ compliance with its Digital Markets Act, which aims to make it easier for smaller companies to compete with global tech giants. It’s the bloc’s latest antitrust action against big tech, though both companies appear likely to appeal the ruling. ILLUSTRATION BY CECILIA RUNXI ZHANG FOR FORBES; IMAGES BY GOOGLE GEMINI AI Florida-based metaverse startup Infinite Reality claims it raised more than $3 billion from a sole unnamed investor, which would make the obscure company the beneficiary of one of the biggest funding rounds of the year. But that’s deeply implausible: The company’s reported revenue figures would give it a higher multiple than the hottest AI startups like Anthropic and OpenAI, and the firm and its CEO have faced a string of lawsuits from creditors who say they are chasing unpaid bills. President Donald Trump has pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world,” and now the investment firm his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick built is backing a new bitcoin venture, along with stablecoin giant Tether and SoftBank Group. Twenty One Capital, a bitcoin accumulation vehicle aimed at Wall Street institutions, will hit the ground running with roughly 42,000 bitcoin, worth $3.6 billion, making it the third-largest corporate bitcoin holder. MORE: The price of Trump’s official meme coin jumped sharply late Wednesday, after an announcement that the token’s top 220 holders will be given a chance to attend an exclusive “gala dinner” with the president, a move that is likely to raise ethical concerns. China dominates the market for rare earth elements, which are used to make everything from missiles to robots and CT scanners, but Australia’s richest woman is working to change that. Gina Rinehart’s $800 million rare earths portfolio, a small part of her $30 billion mining fortune, includes an 8.5% stake in MP Materials, which operates the only working rare earths mine in the U.S. Meta’s oversight board criticized the company’s updates to its hateful conduct policies, such as allowing users to describe LGBTQ people as mentally ill, and urged the company to consider its “human rights impact.” The social media giant announced sweeping changes to its hateful conduct policy and other content moderation standards in January, including abandoning its third-party fact-checking program, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg billed as a move to improve free speech. President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday that a Republican proposal to raise taxes on those earning $1 million or more per year would “be very disruptive because the millionaires would leave the country.” The proposal reportedly would have created a 40% tax rate on millionaires, and appeared to have some initial support from Vice President JD Vance and budget director Russell Vought, according to the Washington Post. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has promised to root out diversity, equity and inclusion, but his No. 2 in charge, billionaire investor Steve Feinberg, has spent nearly $40 million on scholarship programs for Black students in recent years. Feinberg’s foundation’s biggest beneficiary appears to be Tuskegee University, which received a $5 million grant, one of the largest gifts ever for the historically Black school. Illustration by Philip Smith for forbes; Photo by Vatican Pool/Getty Images Choosing a successor to Pope Francis comes at a critical time for the Catholic Church. There are the obvious hot-button theological divisions, but Vatican insiders report that religious issues will not be the only ones debated by the 135 cardinals gathering for the upcoming papal conclave. Some are also concerned with management expertise and who might make a good Vatican CEO. That might come as a surprise to those who think of the Holy See only as the home for the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics. And Vatican City is a sovereign nation with diplomatic missions in 183 countries. So while the next pope needs to be a religious scholar and good communicator, having the skillset of a top CEO might be more necessary now than at any time in the church’s nearly 2,000-year history. The pope, of course, is a non-hereditary monarch and has more executive powers than any CEO on the planet—and he does not have to answer to a board of directors or shareholders. Francis did more during his tenure than any pope to push the Holy See to adapt modern financial practices and no longer operate in the shadows, without oversight or checks and balances. Despite all of his ambition as a reformer, Francis often had to battle a secret internecine war with Vatican bureaucrats who tried undermining his efforts. WHY IT MATTERS Francis’ reign demonstrated that while charisma and a compelling vision for reform is important, it is just as necessary to have a pope who is willing to stand firm against the old guard. While the spiritual vision of the next pope will ultimately determine whether he is an effective leader of the Catholic Church, don’t underestimate the importance of him also being a tough, no-nonsense CEO—with one eye on heaven and the other on the bottom line.

And don’t spend too much time wondering if you’d like the role, it’s worth applying to find out more through the interview process.

    "content": "ByJanhoi McGregor  ByJanhoi McGregor,  Senior Contributor.  The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg This story was updated on April 11th with new Pixel 9a sale details.  Following the Apple iPhone 16 price drop and Samsung’s free Galaxy Watch giveaway, the Google Pixel 9 has joined in with the spring discounts. Don’t forget to hit the follow button above for the latest smartphone pricing news.  Amazon has slashed the price of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL by $204 for the 128GB option, bringing the price down to $894.99. A huge discount for the company’s top flagship model, especially considering the pricing uncertainty because of incoming trade tariffs. The base Pixel 9 has also been discounted by $151.75, bringing the price down to $647. The Pixel 9 Pro and Google Pixel 8 series, however, are still at full price. While the base Pixel 9 deal mimics an Amazon sale last month, the Pixel 9 Pro XL price is one of the biggest discounts I have seen yet. Google has typically knocked $150 off its top handset in the promotions it has run since the devices launched last August. But a straight $200 discount beats those sales comfortably. Amazon can undercut the companies that make these smartphones partly because you’re buying the phone and nothing else. While Samsung and Google will throw in some freebies, store credit or access to subscription services, Amazon’s no-thrill deals involve the device with no extras. The low price also balances Amazon’s poor trade-in valuations. Take a look at the selection of prices Amazon will pay for a used handset against Google’s pricing below (which itself is distinctly average). Google is only beaten on the Apple handset. Note that Amazon doesn’t accept any Google devices beyond the Pixel 5. If you want the best possible price for your old phone, you might be better off selling it on the secondary market. Even with all of the fees and rigmarole that entails. If now is not the right time to pick up a new Pixel phone, Amazon, Google and other retailers will discount the Google Pixel 9 series again, especially as we inch closer to the Pixel 10 release this summer. Update Friday 11th April: Google has officially launched the Pixel 9a and with it a slew of new promotions. First up, the Search company is giving away a $100 store credit with Pixel 9a purchases. Crucially, this can’t be used on the handset itself, rather towards your next buy. Buyers can pick up the Pixel Buds A-series for $99, which is clearly the intention behind that offer. As we have seen before with Samsung, budget wearables are a good makeweight in deals like this. Google has also upped its trade-in prices for your old phone. The company says you can pick up the Pixel 9a for as little as $99 with the right trade-in. That, of course, means handing over a Pixel 8 Pro, or Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. You can get the new phone for free if you swap in the original Pixel Fold or iPhone 15 Pro Max. A slightly more realistic trade-in is the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is worth $405, but that still feels like a downgrade to me. None of these phones should be traded in for the Pixel 9a. More sensical deals include $200 for the Pixel 7a, $280 for the iPhone 14 and $180 for the Pixel 6 Pro.

    "clean_content": "ByJanhoi McGregor ByJanhoi McGregor, Senior Contributor. The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg This story was updated on April 11th with new Pixel 9a sale details. Following the Apple iPhone 16 price drop and Samsung’s free Galaxy Watch giveaway, the Google Pixel 9 has joined in with the spring discounts. Don’t forget to hit the follow button above for the latest smartphone pricing news. Amazon has slashed the price of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL by $204 for the 128GB option, bringing the price down to $894.99. A huge discount for the company’s top flagship model, especially considering the pricing uncertainty because of incoming trade tariffs. The base Pixel 9 has also been discounted by $151.75, bringing the price down to $647. The Pixel 9 Pro and Google Pixel 8 series, however, are still at full price. While the base Pixel 9 deal mimics an Amazon sale last month, the Pixel 9 Pro XL price is one of the biggest discounts I have seen yet. Google has typically knocked $150 off its top handset in the promotions it has run since the devices launched last August. But a straight $200 discount beats those sales comfortably. Amazon can undercut the companies that make these smartphones partly because you’re buying the phone and nothing else. While Samsung and Google will throw in some freebies, store credit or access to subscription services, Amazon’s no-thrill deals involve the device with no extras.

A federal judge ruled this week that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction in its antitrust case with Epic Games, escalating the legal battle over App Store payment policies. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple engineered barriers, including a 27% off-app commission and misleading warning screens, to deter developers from offering alternative payment methods, defying the court’s prior ruling. Epic sued in 2020 to loosen Apple's control over transactions in apps using its iOS operating system. After Apple failed to convince the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the injunction. When it took effect in early 2024, Apple only slightly adjusted its practices. The Judge then referred Apple to the U.S. Attorney for potential criminal contempt, an extraordinary step.

Photographer: Nathan Howard/Bloomberg Google’s Future Is On The Line. The U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Google has evolved into a pivotal battle over the future of artificial intelligence. The DOJ contends that Google's dominance in search is extending into AI, potentially stifling competition in this emerging field. Proposed remedies include divesting the Chrome browser, ending default search engine agreements, and mandating data sharing with rivals . Google CEO Sundar Pichai warns such measures could undermine the company's innovation and compromise user privacy. He argues that forced data sharing would devalue Google's intellectual property and allow competitors to replicate its search engine. This case is the most significant antitrust challenge to a U.S. tech company since the Microsoft default browser trial in the 1990s. Judge Amit Mehta is expected to rule on the proposed remedies by August 2025. The outcome could reshape the competitive landscape of both search and AI industries.

More Thayer/Getty Images) Key Takeaways There’s an old expression on Wall Street. Stocks stair-step higher and go down like jumping out a window. What we saw on Thursday and Friday morning in the premarket is more like off a high rise. On Thursday, stocks lost $3.1 trillion, their worst day since back in March of 2020. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%. Tech stocks led the Nasdaq 6% lower. The Russell 2000 dropped 6.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4%. Ten of the eleven sectors in the S&P were lower on Thursday with energy turning in the worst performance, down 7.5%. The sole sector that was up on the day was consumer staples, gaining 0.7%. Digging beneath the surface, the carnage was even worse with a number of stocks, which were already down on the year, falling 10%. Apple, which was down 9% on Thursday experienced the second largest notional loss in the market's history. Looking at the premarket, the selling looks set to continue. After the close Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced his tariff plans, set to go into effect on April 9. The rates, which many thought was already being priced into markets, were significantly more severe than anticipated. Included in his announcement, the European Union will be taxed at 20%. China, which is already under tariffs, will see an additional 34% increase. A 10% tariff on all imported goods was also announced. According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, that will bring the overall weighted-average tariffs to 23%. Following the U.S. announcement on tariffs, other countries began responding with tariffs of their own. The biggest retaliatory announcement came early Friday morning from China. The Finance Ministry in China announced they would impose 34% tariffs on all U.S. imports, starting on April 10. In addition, China also announced they were suspending certain agricultural products and that they would be tightening export controls on certain rare Earth items. With a full-scale trade war now taking place, odds of a recession in the U.S. have been steadily climbing. JPMorgan has placed the odds of a recession at 60%. While there may be good reason to view any economic forecast with a degree of skepticism, the evidence of a potential recession is showing up in places in the market outside of equities. Oil prices, which touched $72 per barrel on Wednesday, have since fallen over 15% to just over $61 in premarket. Oil prices are used as a proxy for economic health as a strong economy requires more oil, driving prices higher. Weakness in oil is often interpreted as a recessionary indicator. In addition to the fall in oil prices, we're seeing bond prices move higher and interest rates plummet. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note is now below 3.9%. That rate was as high as 4.77% at the beginning of the year. This morning, we received the most recent look at employment. According to Bloomberg, estimates were for 139 thousand new jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.1%. The number of jobs created was higher, at 228,000, while the unemployment rate was 4.2%. There were some sizable revisions however, with both January and February seeing downward revisions totaling 48,000 fewer jobs than were originally reported. For Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak at 10:25 a.m. CT. While I expect him to bob and weave like Muhammad Ali, markets may be looking to him for some sort of assurance that the Fed is willing to cut rates if needed. In addition to Powell, I'm keeping my eye on some individual stocks, like Alibaba, which is off 13% from its high last month. I'm also watching the VIX. I've spoken about the orderly selloffs we've been seeing and how VIX never really jumped to a level where you might see panic selling. In the premarket, VIX has been as high as 45.56, but has since pulled back some to just under 40. Anything over 30 is when you begin seeing panic seep in and that could lead to some choppy trading. For option traders though, the high VIX means option premium is expensive and there may be opportunities for selling that premium.

There were some sizable revisions however, with both January and February seeing downward revisions totaling 48,000 fewer jobs than were originally reported. For Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak at 10:25 a.m. CT. While I expect him to bob and weave like Muhammad Ali, markets may be looking to him for some sort of assurance that the Fed is willing to cut rates if needed. In addition to Powell, I'm keeping my eye on some individual stocks, like Alibaba, which is off 13% from its high last month. I'm also watching the VIX. I've spoken about the orderly selloffs we've been seeing and how VIX never really jumped to a level where you might see panic selling. In the premarket, VIX has been as high as 45.56, but has since pulled back some to just under 40. Anything over 30 is when you begin seeing panic seep in and that could lead to some choppy trading. For option traders though, the high VIX means option premium is expensive and there may be opportunities for selling that premium.

Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction’s goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream.” (This is exactly what it’s done in the EU as well.) “In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,” she continues. “To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath … The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.” “This is an injunction, not a negotiation,” the filing goes on. “The Court will not tolerate further delays.

Apple will no longer be allowed to “audit, monitor, track or require developers to report purchases or any other activity that consumers make outside an app.” Apple cannot restrict the language, style, format, quantity, flow, or placements of links for purchases outside in app. Apple cannot impact the UI developers wishes to use for these links. It can’t exclude certain categories of apps from these requirements, this now impacts all apps. And it cannot interfere with customers that wish to proceed through or outside an app for purchases or any other reason. In short, the judge has done to Apple what I’ve been warning Big Tech for years. They could have found some middle ground and gotten most of what they wanted. But by fighting, lying, and being belligerent, that’s all been taken away from Apple. Now, the requirements of this injunction are dramatically more severe than would have been the case had Apple just done the right thing. “The INJUNCTION IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,” the order notes. “The Court will not entertain a request for a stay given the repeated delays and severity of the conduct.” Bravo.

    "content": "By Antonia Blyth  Executive Editor, Awardsline \n\tWhen Jonathan Tropper first came up with the concept for his new Apple TV+ series Your Friends and Neighbors, he recalled his longtime experience living in a tony Westchester neighborhood for some 15 years. What if a person fell on hard times and felt the pressure to keep up? How easy would it be for them to resort to lifting a few pricey items from their affluent friends to hawk on the side? At the center of Tropper’s story is Andrew “Coop” Cooper— a man down on his luck and freshly out of a job. Disenfranchised with the materialistic world he’d bought into, his wife (Amanda Peet) has left him for his best friend (Mark Tallman), and his burgeoning relationship with Sam (Olivia Munn) is rocky. The more Tropper thought about it, the more one actor appeared in his mind for Coop: Jon Hamm. When they met, Hamm was on board and would ultimately join as executive producer. Tropper wrote with him in mind and the outcome is a character that blasts Hamm back into a leading television role that combines social commentary, dark humor, twisty relationships and a murder mystery.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApple CEO Tim Cook Sees $900 Million Hit From Tariffs In June Quarter If Rates Stay The Same - Update\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCasting\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRome Flynn, Ana Ortiz & Sherri Saum Join Apple Limited Series 'Imperfect Women'\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDEADLINE: I’ve been such a fan of your work forever and have read all your books, starting with This is Where I Leave You. And this show feels like it is in the vein of those novels, which are such meaty relationship pieces.\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \nJONATHAN TROPPER: That’s not an accident. \nDEADLINE: How did the idea for a guy who steals from his friends to keep up his lifestyle come about? Were you inspired by the time you spent living in Westchester? \nTROPPER: I don’t live there now, but I lived there for about 15 years. I’ve set some of my books in similar neighborhoods. Just living there for 15 years and feeling like I really understood the area and understood the aesthetic and understood the mentality of the people who lived there. And also not unimportantly, I lived there during the huge internet boom, the internet bubble in the early 2000s, was there for the crash, was there for all of the hedge fund money that started pouring into people’s pockets, and then the Madoff disaster which affected a lot of people I knew. \n\tAnd so I was kind of watching people’s worths evolve in real time and also watching people’s value systems evolve in real time. And as a novelist, living among finance people, I didn’t have that level of income. And so there was a little bit of that Persian Letters effect where I could watch it, the stock market crash didn’t affect me directly. I wasn’t in the market, I wasn’t in finance, and I didn’t make nearly as much as the people around me, and so it was kind of an interesting place to be sitting and absorbing it.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tSo I always knew I wanted to do a show set there. It just, no one was going to let me, it took a while till I reached a point where I was allowed to, so. \nDEADLINE: If you don’t live there anymore you can skewer those people? \nTROPPER: Yeah, although I don’t think the show really is a skewer, I think it’s done with love. And at the same time, there is something both internally broken about it and now something that’s breaking externally because [of the state of] the world and the permanence of everything has been called into question. And the sustainability of this type of income, this type of lifestyle, I think that’s all starting to seem a lot less of a promise than it used to be. \nDEADLINE: So when did you first light on the kernel of the idea of your protagonist? I know that you met Jon and then it evolved with Jon in mind as you wrote, but when did the idea first land for this guy who steals to keep up with the neighbors? \nTROPPER: I don’t remember the exact moment, but I do remember while I was still living there, I walked into a friend’s house looking for someone or something, and nobody was home. And I was just in this really nice house by myself, and I realized how easy that is and how easy somebody who looked like me could explain it if I happened to get caught. So, it just became this idea that in any kind of fishbowl community, it doesn’t have to be a wealthy community, in any fishbowl community there’s a really tremendous importance placed on status. And somebody who suddenly could not maintain the status might be tempted to maintain it in other ways. And it would really be kind of easy if you were willing to just forget the rules. It might be really easy to walk into these places and you would know where to go and what to take because you know where people are during the day, you know your friends’ schedules, you know what’s going on. So, it felt like something somebody really desperate might do. \nDEADLINE: I can’t imagine anyone else pulling off this character other than Jon Hamm. \nTROPPER: Me too. From the minute I developed the idea, my intention was the best way to get this up and running, because it’s not based on IP, it’s not based on some popular book or some property that the studio already owns, is I need to come in with a star. And the problem was the only person I could really see in the role was Jon Hamm, and the problem was I didn’t know Jon Hamm. \n\tIt’s one of those things that shouldn’t have worked out but did. I got my agent to arrange a lunch, and I met him for the first time and I pitched him the idea. And I think the fact that we’re very close in age and have the same cultural touchstones and there’s a tremendous midlife component to this show, it’s that moment where you wake up and you stop seeing the matrix, or you suddenly see the matrix, but that moment when you realize you’ve been following a lot of scripts that you didn’t write yourself and maybe you follow the wrong ones. So, I think there was a lot of that, and there was a lot of just an understanding at our age of how much angst and ennui and regret there was to be mined in a situation like this. I think him getting excited about it got me excited about it, which led me to go write the pilot. And when I sent him the pilot, the reaction was instant and that we just said, “Great, let’s go sell it.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDEADLINE: You talk about people following the wrong script and waking up to that in midlife. I really felt like there was a little bit of Lester Burnham from American Beauty there too in Coop. \nTROPPER: American Beauty definitely a touchpoint for this. \nDEADLINE: Yeah, I really felt that. Not in a derivative way, I just mean that that’s an iconic character and for me, it resonates because when you hit a certain age, you realize that you can’t collect enough things to bring you anything that resembles happiness. So then you think, “What is it that I’m doing?” And that’s the classic midlife crisis. \nTROPPER: Yeah, it’s the quiet desperation of the upper middle class. It’s been done since Henry James, right? It’s been done forever. But there’s something about doing it at a time where our politics are so fraught and the wellbeing of our planet, our country, and our neighborhoods literally can change on a dime now. I think there’s much more rawness to the notion of you don’t have forever to get it right. When you wake up, the urgency to fix your life is much greater, especially when you’re in middle age. \nDEADLINE: Yeah, it’s terrifying. But the next thing I wanted to get to is, I love that you’ve brought back the voice-over in a real way. You’ve given it what it really needed all along, which is it’s not a device to fill in holes, it’s a character, it’s separate. Jon’s playing two roles, basically. \nTROPPER: It made me so happy to hear you say that, but yes. That was the goal, and the fear was that once I implemented it, that I would get asked to use it as a fix for things. So, when I presented it, I made it really clear, and I’m lucky to have very artistically minded executives at Apple that said, “No, we’re not going to solve that problem by adding voice-over.” Voice-over is a very specific thing. It’s to add texture and it’s to do another character study on our main character that’s separate from the character you’re seeing on the screen. And it’s really inspired, honestly, by Raymond Chandler, Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade, it’s the noir from the ’60s, which is by the way, why you see him sometimes watching that on TV. I loved those movies when I was younger and it was always the notion that whatever this guy’s going through on the screen, there’s an older, wiser version of him reflecting on it. And that, to me, gives you a great way to also empathize with a character who in the moment you might not, but because he’s talking to you from a distance where he’s achieved some level of nebulous wisdom, you get to understand the character twice at once. I think he has the omniscience of having been there already, but he’s future Coop. But the question is, is he five minutes in the future Coop or is he 10 years in the future Coop? Is he talking to you from the Riviera or from a jail cell? We have no idea. He’s future Coop. \nDEADLINE: You’ve been renewed already for Season 2. Do you know how this ends? \nTROPPER: I knew very clearly how the first season would end, and I have a very strong idea of emotionally where it ends, but plot-wise I’m still figuring that out. \nDEADLINE: When you talked about the voice-over with Jon, did you collaborate on that to get it to sound like him? \nTROPPER: Jon has done a lot of voice-over in his life professionally, both in the advertising world and in other situations. We developed the idea of what the voice-over is going to do in the writers room. Sometimes that would stay, sometimes we’d have to reimagine it post writers room. I would write it, but what would often happen with Jon is on the day we’d record it, we’d record it twice, we’d record it once just a half. And by the time we got to the studio, Jon had had time to think about it. It was tricky to figure out all the tenses, we had to play with the tenses a lot. And we’d work on that largely on the day in the studio. And then he’d come up with sort of, “Well, maybe he’s expressing it this way and maybe that.” I think he’s very intuitive and he likes to come in on the day and figure some of it out when it comes to the voice-over.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDEADLINE: It’s so important that you make him likable at the same time as interesting and subversive, otherwise why are we here, right? \nTROPPER: There’s a really good literary trick for doing that, and it’s called casting Jon Hamm. \nDEADLINE: He definitely brings that, but in your writing and in your directing there are some key points where we know we like him. The way he handles being hit on for example. He doesn’t do any of the things that a less likeable man might do. And that’s when we first know, “Oh, this is a good guy. This is not your typical guy.” \nTROPPER: That’s a constant battle, and there are certain things we’ve institutionalized into the show that help. For instance, his sister. This is a guy who takes care of his grown sister. And so, no matter how you judge him and any of his other behaviors, there’s one part of his life that’s completely uncorrupted, and that’s his relationship with his sister, where you can get a sense of the real character of this man, right? His sister has been in his life for his whole life and I think there are certain North Stars, and one thing you understand about him is no matter what he’s doing, his sister comes first. \n\tWe also did an episode where he and Mel went back to Princeton, and you got a sense of what they were like before all of this. Without doing a flashback, we were able to find a way to convey the sweetness of their relationship, the consideration of each other that you’re not seeing necessarily in the other episodes. So it’s just about picking moments to show the person he was on his way to becoming this person. And then in the moment there’s always tempering the dialogue — is he too harsh here? Is he not harsh enough? Do we want him to actually be seemingly unredemptively unlikable in this moment so that we can redeem him in that moment? And it’s an ongoing conversation. \nDEADLINE: Can you tell me a little bit about casting the rest of them from Olivia Munn to Lena Hall to Mark Tallman to Hoon Lee? \nTROPPER: The beauty of having Jon in it from the beginning was I really felt we can call anybody. And I started thinking about who I really admired. Amanda Peet, 20 years, more than that, of watching her movies, of seeing her on TV and knowing she had the same ability he has, which is so important to the show, to walk the line between comedy and drama, to merge them together and make someone sympathetic even when they’re acting out. \n\tMel had to have all the same characteristics of Coop, which is that sometimes she’s not going to behave very well, and we’re starting out learning that she’s had an affair, right? But it doesn’t take you more than five minutes to fall in love with her anyway, because you understand this is a really human person with a lot of depth who’s trying really hard. I thought she just conveys instant empathy, instant sympathy, and instant buy-in to how complicated she is. And her line delivery is insane. Her ability to find the meat of a line and do it six different ways, it’s just amazing to watch. And then Olivia, ever since I’d seen her in The Newsroom, I’ve been dying to write for her. \nDEADLINE: I’m obsessed with how she played her character in The Newsroom. Oh my god. \nTROPPER: Right? And I love the idea of the beautiful woman who’s also a neurotic, insecure mess. And I’m not going to compare myself to Sorkin, but just, watching her deliver his stuff, I really wanted a chance to write for her. I actually tried to get her for my previous show Warrior, and I was willing to write a whole character for her, but we got canceled before I got the chance to do that.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tBut we’d been put in touch then. And then when I was thinking about this character, she just seemed perfect for it. And I was thrilled that we were able to get both of them, because now it felt like whatever I write is going to get elevated by that trio almost instantly. \nDEADLINE: And I love Hoon Lee’s character of Coop’s friend and business advisor Barney so much. \nTROPPER: I never do a show without Hoon since my first show. I think the end of Season 1 of Your Friends & Neighbors was our 85th episode of television together. We did four seasons of Banshee, three seasons of Warrior, one season of See, and then Your Friends & Neighbors. And the thing I love about him is also his innate understanding of comedy and drama and how to fuse them. He has such a giant brain. Wherever he goes, the smartest person in the room, and that comes across and he makes me look really good, he makes me seem like a much smarter writer. He just brings an intelligence and I don’t think you can act that intelligence, you have to have that intelligence. And that’s why I always write a role for Hoon. \n\tProbably our hardest bit of casting was Mark Tallman, because we needed a guy who has slept with his friend’s wife, but you still believe is an earnest, sincere, sympathetic guy, and is an athlete. Let me tell you something, it’s a tall order. \nDEADLINE: Literally. \nTROPPER: He took us the longest to cast. We went through everybody. We could find somebody really sexy who might not be funny. We could find someone really funny who you don’t buy as sexy. We needed to believe this is somebody Mel would be in a relationship with. And it was a lot of work to find him. We ended up finding him in our backyard in Brooklyn. \nDEADLINE: You’ve said you’re working on Season 2, what do you want to achieve with it? \nTROPPER: The comparison I always give, and I’m sorry that I’m such a geek, but Season 2 is always The Empire Strikes Back. \nDEADLINE: That’s a very relevant reference for you right now, given you’re working on the new Star Wars film with Shawn Levy… \nTROPPER: Season 2 has to get darker, more complex, and the stakes have to get much higher. And we’ve written most of the episodes. We go into production three days after the show comes out, so we’re ready. \nDEADLINE: Is everybody coming back? I really hope so. \nTROPPER: Everyone’s back, yes. That’s the advantage to getting picked up so quickly is I can keep my production team, I can keep my crew, I can keep the actors engaged, everyone’s in their group. And as long as they want us to make the show, we’re going to try to come back quickly so that everyone can really stay in the zone. I’m a big believer in not flushing the format too early. I want Season 2 to be a returning pleasure for people who love Season 1, and at the same time we have to up the ante, we have to take the characters in different directions. \n\tAlso, one of the things Jon’s always been pretty firm on is that what Coop is doing is not a sustainable way to make a living. So, we’ve got to figure out how this evolves for him in Season 2 and then 3. And our plan is definitely not the Walter White plan. He’s not becoming a criminal kingpin. The idea is more about he’s being liberated, and so what’s the next stage of his liberation? \nDEADLINE: Since you brought it up, I have to assume that you’ve been a massive Star Wars fan for life then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTROPPER: Star Wars is, for me, and I think most people my age, and certainly most people my age in the entertainment business, everything. I was 7 years old when Star Wars came out, and I have a visceral memory of my dad driving us all into Manhattan. In those days you’d go to one of these big theaters where the red curtain was still over the screen, and when it said, “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the screen parted, and I have visceral memories of that. \nDEADLINE: How did you feel when you got the writing job on this new installment? \nTROPPER: Well, it was both one of the most exciting days of my career and I felt like everything I’d been doing had been almost like the audition to get me this job, but at the same time, [there was] a lot of wariness. I knew how hard the development process would be and that most people don’t make it across the finish line. So, I had a healthy amount of skepticism, but I was also determined to be a part of the team that made it across the finish line. \nDEADLINE: And what about working with Shawn? \nTROPPER: Well, that’s what made it really great for me, is that Shawn and I, this is our fourth project together, and we live around the corner from each other. So we were like two giddy boys who were given the keys to dad’s car. We’ve been having a blast doing it. And also, when you have someone like Shawn who is so used to these massive productions, he really bears the weight of all of that and kind of just focuses me on the writing. So yeah, no, it seems also like everything we did together until now was to prepare us to do this together, so it’s been really satisfying. \nDEADLINE: I wanted to ask you about Lucky as well. You have so many great things coming up, but what can you tell me about that? \nTROPPER: We’re in the middle of shooting here in California. \nDEADLINE: I’m glad you’re shooting in California. \nTROPPER: Yeah, we’re shooting in California, and we have a phenomenal cast with Anya Taylor-Joy, Tim Olyphant, Annette Bening, other people have been announced. And it was just a real surprise to me. I was thrilled when Hello Sunshine sent me the book, and there’s something really exciting about a one-and-done limited series with this level of cast and it’s a bit different from other stuff I’ve written, but it’s just been a lot of fun putting it together, and we have a great team doing it and it makes it possible for me to work on Your Friends and Neighbors and this, and I’m super excited for it. I mean, it’s very different from things I’ve done, so I’m very excited about it. \n\tYour Friends and Neighbors is on Apple TV+ from April 11. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

    "clean_content": "By Antonia Blyth Executive Editor, Awardsline When Jonathan Tropper first came up with the concept for his new Apple TV+ series Your Friends and Neighbors, he recalled his longtime experience living in a tony Westchester neighborhood for some 15 years. What if a person fell on hard times and felt the pressure to keep up? How easy would it be for them to resort to lifting a few pricey items from their affluent friends to hawk on the side? At the center of Tropper’s story is Andrew “Coop” Cooper— a man down on his luck and freshly out of a job. Disenfranchised with the materialistic world he’d bought into, his wife  has left him for his best friend , and his burgeoning relationship with Sam  is rocky. The more Tropper thought about it, the more one actor appeared in his mind for Coop: Jon Hamm. When they met, Hamm was on board and would ultimately join as executive producer. Tropper wrote with him in mind and the outcome is a character that blasts Hamm back into a leading television role that combines social commentary, dark humor, twisty relationships and a murder mystery. Related Stories News Apple CEO Tim Cook Sees $900 Million Hit From Tariffs In June Quarter If Rates Stay The Same - Update Casting Rome Flynn, Ana Ortiz & Sherri Saum Join Apple Limited Series 'Imperfect Women' DEADLINE: I’ve been such a fan of your work forever and have read all your books, starting with This is Where I Leave You. And this show feels like it is in the vein of those novels, which are such meaty relationship pieces. Watch on Deadline JONATHAN TROPPER: That’s not an accident. DEADLINE: How did the idea for a guy who steals from his friends to keep up his lifestyle come about? Were you inspired by the time you spent living in Westchester? TROPPER: I don’t live there now, but I lived there for about 15 years. I’ve set some of my books in similar neighborhoods. Just living there for 15 years and feeling like I really understood the area and understood the aesthetic and understood the mentality of the people who lived there. And also not unimportantly, I lived there during the huge internet boom, the internet bubble in the early 2000s, was there for the crash, was there for all of the hedge fund money that started pouring into people’s pockets, and then the Madoff disaster which affected a lot of people I knew. And so I was kind of watching people’s worths evolve in real time and also watching people’s value systems evolve in real time. And as a novelist, living among finance people, I didn’t have that level of income. And so there was a little bit of that Persian Letters effect where I could watch it, the stock market crash didn’t affect me directly. I wasn’t in the market, I wasn’t in finance, and I didn’t make nearly as much as the people around me, and so it was kind of an interesting place to be sitting and absorbing it. So I always knew I wanted to do a show set there. It just, no one was going to let me, it took a while till I reached a point where I was allowed to, so. DEADLINE: If you don’t live there anymore you can skewer those people? TROPPER: Yeah, although I don’t think the show really is a skewer, I think it’s done with love. And at the same time, there is something both internally broken about it and now something that’s breaking externally because  the world and the permanence of everything has been called into question. And the sustainability of this type of income, this type of lifestyle, I think that’s all starting to seem a lot less of a promise than it used to be. DEADLINE: So when did you first light on the kernel of the idea of your protagonist? I know that you met Jon and then it evolved with Jon in mind as you wrote, but when did the idea first land for this guy who steals to keep up with the neighbors? TROPPER: I don’t remember the exact moment, but I do remember while I was still living there, I walked into a friend’s house looking for someone or something, and nobody was home. And I was just in this really nice house by myself, and I realized how easy that is and how easy somebody who looked like me could explain it if I happened to get caught. So, it just became this idea that in any kind of fishbowl community, it doesn’t have to be a wealthy community, in any fishbowl community there’s a really tremendous importance placed on status. And somebody who suddenly could not maintain the status might be tempted to maintain it in other ways. And it would really be kind of easy if you were willing to just forget the rules. It might be really easy to walk into these places and you would know where to go and what to take because you know where people are during the day, you know your friends’ schedules, you know what’s going on. So, it felt like something somebody really desperate might do. DEADLINE: I can’t imagine anyone else pulling off this character other than Jon Hamm. TROPPER: Me too. From the minute I developed the idea, my intention was the best way to get this up and running, because it’s not based on IP, it’s not based on some popular book or some property that the studio already owns, is I need to come in with a star. And the problem was the only person I could really see in the role was Jon Hamm, and the problem was I didn’t know Jon Hamm. It’s one of those things that shouldn’t have worked out but did. I got my agent to arrange a lunch, and I met him for the first time and I pitched him the idea. And I think the fact that we’re very close in age and have the same cultural touchstones and there’s a tremendous midlife component to this show, it’s that moment where you wake up and you stop seeing the matrix, or you suddenly see the matrix, but that moment when you realize you’ve been following a lot of scripts that you didn’t write yourself and maybe you follow the wrong ones. So, I think there was a lot of that, and there was a lot of just an understanding at our age of how much angst and ennui and regret there was to be mined in a situation like this. I think him getting excited about it got me excited about it, which led me to go write the pilot. And when I sent him the pilot, the reaction was instant and that we just said, “Great, let’s go sell it.” DEADLINE: You talk about people following the wrong script and waking up to that in midlife. I really felt like there was a little bit of Lester Burnham from American Beauty there too in Coop. TROPPER: American Beauty definitely a touchpoint for this. DEADLINE: Yeah, I really felt that. Not in a derivative way, I just mean that that’s an iconic character and for me, it resonates because when you hit a certain age, you realize that you can’t collect enough things to bring you anything that resembles happiness. So then you think, “What is it that I’m doing?” And that’s the classic midlife crisis. TROPPER: Yeah, it’s the quiet desperation of the upper middle class. It’s been done since Henry James, right? It’s been done forever. But there’s something about doing it at a time where our politics are so fraught and the wellbeing of our planet, our country, and our neighborhoods literally can change on a dime now. I think there’s much more rawness to the notion of you don’t have forever to get it right. When you wake up, the urgency to fix your life is much greater, especially when you’re in middle age. DEADLINE: Yeah, it’s terrifying. But the next thing I wanted to get to is, I love that you’ve brought back the voice-over in a real way. You’ve given it what it really needed all along, which is it’s not a device to fill in holes, it’s a character, it’s separate. Jon’s playing two roles, basically. TROPPER: It made me so happy to hear you say that, but yes. That was the goal, and the fear was that once I implemented it, that I would get asked to use it as a fix for things. So, when I presented it, I made it really clear, and I’m lucky to have very artistically minded executives at Apple that said, “No, we’re not going to solve that problem by adding voice-over.” Voice-over is a very specific thing. It’s to add texture and it’s to do another character study on our main character that’s separate from the character you’re seeing on the screen. And it’s really inspired, honestly, by Raymond Chandler, Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade, it’s the noir from the ’60s, which is by the way, why you see him sometimes watching that on TV. I loved those movies when I was younger and it was always the notion that whatever this guy’s going through on the screen, there’s an older, wiser version of him reflecting on it. And that, to me, gives you a great way to also empathize with a character who in the moment you might not, but because he’s talking to you from a distance where he’s achieved some level of nebulous wisdom, you get to understand the character twice at once. I think he has the omniscience of having been there already, but he’s future Coop. But the question is, is he five minutes in the future Coop or is he 10 years in the future Coop? Is he talking to you from the Riviera or from a jail cell? We have no idea. He’s future Coop. DEADLINE: You’ve been renewed already for Season 2. Do you know how this ends? TROPPER: I knew very clearly how the first season would end, and I have a very strong idea of emotionally where it ends, but plot-wise I’m still figuring that out. DEADLINE: When you talked about the voice-over with Jon, did you collaborate on that to get it to sound like him? TROPPER: Jon has done a lot of voice-over in his life professionally, both in the advertising world and in other situations. We developed the idea of what the voice-over is going to do in the writers room. Sometimes that would stay, sometimes we’d have to reimagine it post writers room. I would write it, but what would often happen with Jon is on the day we’d record it, we’d record it twice, we’d record it once just a half. And by the time we got to the studio, Jon had had time to think about it. It was tricky to figure out all the tenses, we had to play with the tenses a lot. And we’d work on that largely on the day in the studio. And then he’d come up with sort of, “Well, maybe he’s expressing it this way and maybe that.” I think he’s very intuitive and he likes to come in on the day and figure some of it out when it comes to the voice-over. DEADLINE: It’s so important that you make him likable at the same time as interesting and subversive, otherwise why are we here, right? TROPPER: There’s a really good literary trick for doing that, and it’s called casting Jon Hamm. DEADLINE: He definitely brings that, but in your writing and in your directing there are some key points where we know we like him. The way he handles being hit on for example. He doesn’t do any of the things that a less likeable man might do. And that’s when we first know, “Oh, this is a good guy. This is not your typical guy.” TROPPER: That’s a constant battle, and there are certain things we’ve institutionalized into the show that help. For instance, his sister. This is a guy who takes care of his grown sister. And so, no matter how you judge him and any of his other behaviors, there’s one part of his life that’s completely uncorrupted, and that’s his relationship with his sister, where you can get a sense of the real character of this man, right? His sister has been in his life for his whole life and I think there are certain North Stars, and one thing you understand about him is no matter what he’s doing, his sister comes first. We also did an episode where he and Mel went back to Princeton, and you got a sense of what they were like before all of this. Without doing a flashback, we were able to find a way to convey the sweetness of their relationship, the consideration of each other that you’re not seeing necessarily in the other episodes. So it’s just about picking moments to show the person he was on his way to becoming this person. And then in the moment there’s always tempering the dialogue — is he too harsh here? Is he not harsh enough? Do we want him to actually be seemingly unredemptively unlikable in this moment so that we can redeem him in that moment? And it’s an ongoing conversation. DEADLINE: Can you tell me a little bit about casting the rest of them from Olivia Munn to Lena Hall to Mark Tallman to Hoon Lee? TROPPER: The beauty of having Jon in it from the beginning was I really felt we can call anybody. And I started thinking about who I really admired. Amanda Peet, 20 years, more than that, of watching her movies, of seeing her on TV and knowing she had the same ability he has, which is so important to the show, to walk the line between comedy and drama, to merge them together and make someone sympathetic even when they’re acting out. Mel had to have all the same characteristics of Coop, which is that sometimes she’s not going to behave very well, and we’re starting out learning that she’s had an affair, right? But it doesn’t take you more than five minutes to fall in love with her anyway, because you understand this is a really human person with a lot of depth who’s trying really hard. I thought she just conveys instant empathy, instant sympathy, and instant buy-in to how complicated she is. And her line delivery is insane. Her ability to find the meat of a line and do it six different ways, it’s just amazing to watch. And then Olivia, ever since I’d seen her in The Newsroom, I’ve been dying to write for her. DEADLINE: I’m obsessed with how she played her character in The Newsroom. Oh my god. TROPPER: Right? And I love the idea of the beautiful woman who’s also a neurotic, insecure mess. And I’m not going to compare myself to Sorkin, but just, watching her deliver his stuff, I really wanted a chance to write for her. I actually tried to get her for my previous show Warrior, and I was willing to write a whole character for her, but we got canceled before I got the chance to do that. But we’d been put in touch then. And then when I was thinking about this character, she just seemed perfect for it. And I was thrilled that we were able to get both of them, because now it felt like whatever I write is going to get elevated by that trio almost instantly. DEADLINE: And I love Hoon Lee’s character of Coop’s friend and business advisor Barney so much. TROPPER: I never do a show without Hoon since my first show. I think the end of Season 1 of Your Friends & Neighbors was our 85th episode of television together. We did four seasons of Banshee, three seasons of Warrior, one season of See, and then Your Friends & Neighbors. And the thing I love about him is also his innate understanding of comedy and drama and how to fuse them. He has such a giant brain. Wherever he goes, the smartest person in the room, and that comes across and he makes me look really good, he makes me seem like a much smarter writer. He just brings an intelligence and I don’t think you can act that intelligence, you have to have that intelligence. And that’s why I always write a role for Hoon. Probably our hardest bit of casting was Mark Tallman, because we needed a guy who has slept with his friend’s wife, but you still believe is an earnest, sincere, sympathetic guy, and is an athlete. Let me tell you something, it’s a tall order. DEADLINE: Literally. TROPPER: He took us the longest to cast. We went through everybody. We could find somebody really sexy who might not be funny. We could find someone really funny who you don’t buy as sexy. We needed to believe this is somebody Mel would be in a relationship with. And it was a lot of work to find him. We ended up finding him in our backyard in Brooklyn. DEADLINE: You’ve said you’re working on Season 2, what do you want to achieve with it? TROPPER: The comparison I always give, and I’m sorry that I’m such a geek, but Season 2 is always The Empire Strikes Back. DEADLINE: That’s a very relevant reference for you right now, given you’re working on the new Star Wars film with Shawn Levy… TROPPER: Season 2 has to get darker, more complex, and the stakes have to get much higher. And we’ve written most of the episodes. We go into production three days after the show comes out, so we’re ready. DEADLINE: Is everybody coming back? I really hope so. TROPPER: Everyone’s back, yes. That’s the advantage to getting picked up so quickly is I can keep my production team, I can keep my crew, I can keep the actors engaged, everyone’s in their group. And as long as they want us to make the show, we’re going to try to come back quickly so that everyone can really stay in the zone. I’m a big believer in not flushing the format too early. I want Season 2 to be a returning pleasure for people who love Season 1, and at the same time we have to up the ante, we have to take the characters in different directions. Also, one of the things Jon’s always been pretty firm on is that what Coop is doing is not a sustainable way to make a living. So, we’ve got to figure out how this evolves for him in Season 2 and then 3. And our plan is definitely not the Walter White plan. He’s not becoming a criminal kingpin. The idea is more about he’s being liberated, and so what’s the next stage of his liberation? DEADLINE: Since you brought it up, I have to assume that you’ve been a massive Star Wars fan for life then? TROPPER: Star Wars is, for me, and I think most people my age, and certainly most people my age in the entertainment business, everything. I was 7 years old when Star Wars came out, and I have a visceral memory of my dad driving us all into Manhattan.

Everyone is buzzing over this trade war, including America’s highest paid executives and CEOs. Big names in finance are predicting a recession — and that’s not making the top dogs in business happy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon sounded the alarm, warning that the trade policy will likely spike inflation and slow down growth.

    "content": "Indonesia’s currency is at a record low against the US dollar amid concerns over President Prabowo Subianto’s policies. Indonesia’s rupiah is trading at record lows against the US dollar, stirring memories of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. While the rupiah has been battered by the market uncertainty stemming from US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, the currency’s slide began weeks before Wednesday’s “Liberation Day” announcement. Since the inauguration of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto in October, the rupiah has slid about 8 percent against the dollar amid concerns about the former general’s stewardship of Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and most populous nation. The rupiah’s plunge mirrors the collapse of the currency in 1998, which led to a financial crisis that helped bring about the end of three decades of authoritarian rule by President Soeharto. “What’s happening in Indonesia now reflects how confident global investors and markets are in the economic decisions of the current leadership,” Achmad Sukarsono, an analyst who covers Indonesia at the Control Risks consultancy firm in Singapore, told Al Jazeera. The rupiah has been falling steadily since shortly before Prabowo took office, hitting an all-time low of 16,850 on Tuesday. While the rupiah has seen its share of highs and lows over the past 28 years – including throughout the COVID-19 pandemic – its fall below the 1998 threshold is psychologically important for Indonesians because of the currency’s role in Soeharto’s ouster, according to Hal Hill, a professor emeritus of Southeast Asian economies at the Australian National University (ANU). “There’s still that memory that if the Indonesia rupiah declines quite a bit, people start to get edgy, and they think it’s a repeat of the earlier crisis,” Hill told Al Jazeera. Currencies depreciate for several reasons, including political uncertainty, inflation, trade imbalances with other countries, and speculation by investors. In the case of Indonesia, Prabowo’s policies – including a $30bn free school lunch programme, plans to weaken the independence of the central bank, and restrictions on foreign companies such as Apple – have shaken investors’ faith in the economy. “It’s all about heightened uncertainties” and a “significant drop in market confidence”, Arianto Patunru, an economist and fellow at the ANU Indonesia Project, told Al Jazeera. Prabowo’s establishment of the Danantara sovereign wealth fund using $20bn in government funds, and his push to allow members of the military to hold more civilian posts – a move that critics have said hearkens back to Soeharto’s dictatorial rule – have also stoked concern. Last month, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who was widely credited for her role in steering Indonesia through the 2007-09 global financial crisis, was forced to dispel rumours that she planned to resign amid the turmoil in the financial and currency markets. On top of its domestic challenges, Indonesia, like many developing economies, is at the same time grappling with the double whammy of China’s economic slowdown and the fallout of Trump’s escalating trade war. In his “Liberation Day” announcement on Wednesday, Trump unveiled a 32 percent tariff on Indonesian imports. Indonesia, a middle-income country with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $4,960 in 2024, has seen its economy grow at a solid pace in recent years. GDP rose by more than 5 percent last year, after similar expansions in 2023 and 2023. But those headline figures do not capture a marked deterioration in living standards for large numbers of Indonesians. The number of Indonesians classified as middle class by Jakarta’s Central Bureau of Statistics – defined as those with monthly outgoings of between 2 million rupiahs ($118) and 9.9 million rupiahs ($585) – fell from 57.3 million in 2019 to 47.8 million last year, a decline attributed to factors including higher inflation and the lingering effect of COVID-19. In March, former finance Minister Muhammad Chatib Basri described the country’s middle class as an “economically distressed population” with a weakening purchasing power and limited savings. “Indonesia is in its most challenging and difficult period since the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis and there are both domestic and international reasons for that,” ANU’s Hill said. “The domestic reason is a new president. The business community is still trying to work out where he wants to go and manage the fiscal situation, and that’s combined with the external environment.” Control Risks’ Sukarsono said the country’s economic challenges raised questions about Prabowo’s priorities. “When the government should focus more on factors that have caused the current shrinking of the middle class, it is bafflingly more preoccupied with programmes that do not address the decline in purchasing power and the waves of layoffs amid the deteriorating condition of the labour-intensive segment of the manufacturing sector,” Sukarsono said.

    "content": "Watch CBS News \nUpdated on:  April 30, 2025 / 10:36 PM EDT\n          / CBS/AP\n         A federal judge has strongly rebuked Apple, finding that the iPhone maker willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. On Wednesday, she found that Apple violated a 2021 injunction that, she wrote, sought to \"restrain and prohibit the iPhone maker's anticompetitive conduct\" and pricing. \"Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote in Wednesday's ruling, which held Apple in contempt. She ordered that Apple \"no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.\" In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday night, an Apple spokesperson said: \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\"   Epic first filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce. Although Gonzalez Rogers had rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. The Supreme Court rejected Apple's appeal in the case in January 2024. \"In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,\" the judge wrote on Wednesday. She accused Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman of \"outright\" lying under oath. \"Internally, (longtime Apple executive) Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but (CEO) Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote. The judge referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Justice Department filed a comprehensive antitrust lawsuit against Apple last year, alleging that the tech giant engaged in a series of efforts to stifle competition.  \n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "content": "Beijing says it will impose an additional 34 percent tax on US goods from next week in retaliation for Washington’s tariffs. China has announced a slew of countermeasures against tariffs imposed by United States President Donald Trump, including additional tariffs of 34 percent on all goods and curbs on the export of some rare earths, deepening an escalating trade war. Trump on Wednesday announced that China would be hit with a 34-percent tariff, on top of the 20 percent he imposed earlier this year, bringing the total new levies to 54 percent. On Friday, China’s Ministry of Finance said the additional tariffs would be imposed from April 10. Beijing has previously imposed tariffs of 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US in retaliation for Washington’s 10 percent levies on Chinese goods. It also announced stiff export controls on key minerals and businesses, limiting what could be exchanged with the US. “The purpose of the Chinese government’s implementation of export controls on relevant items in accordance with the law is to better safeguard national security and interests, and to fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation,” the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. On Friday morning, Trump responded to the slate of retaliatory measures with a fiery social-media post written in all capital letters. “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. But China has pushed forward with countering Trump’s aggressive trade policies, saying it had opened a formal complaint against the new US tariffs with the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday. As part of its complaint, Beijing argued the measures violate WTO rules and requesting consultations. “China has filed the WTO complaint with respect to the United States’ measures,” the Permanent Mission of China to the World Trade Organization said in a statement. Beijing also imposed sweeping export controls to limit the exchange of goods and services with the US. Some pertained to the export of medium and heavy rare earths to the US, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, effective from April 4. Others took aim at US businesses. China added 16 US entities to its export control list, which bans the export of dual-use items to affected firms. Another 11 US firms were included on the “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive action against foreign entities. The targeted firms includes Skydio Inc and BRINC Drones over arms sales to democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the targeted companies seriously “undermined” China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests and would be banned from new investments, import and export activities in China. Agriculture trade took a hit as well, as Chinese customs imposed an immediate suspension on imports of sorghums from grain exporter C&D (USA) Inc, as well as poultry and bonemeal from three US firms. Then there were the threats of further regulatory action. Beijing announced it had launched an anti-dumping probe, looking into imports of certain medical CT tubes from the US and India. It also said it would pursue a wider investigation into how the medical industry’s competitiveness was affected by imports of medical CT tubes. US stock futures fell sharply on Friday, signalling more losses on Wall Street, as the Trump administration’s sweeping levies knocked $2.4 trillion from US equities. Shares of Big Tech stocks fell in premarket trading, with companies such as Apple and Nvidia having big exposure to China and Taiwan for manufacturing their products. In Japan, a top US trading partner, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said the tariffs had created a “national crisis”, as a plunge in banking shares on Friday set Tokyo’s stock market on course for its worst week in years. European shares were also headed for the biggest weekly loss in three years. But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday disputed any economic crash, telling reporters that markets were reacting to the change and would adjust. “Their economies are not crashing. Their markets are reacting to a dramatic change in the global order in terms of trade,” he said at a media conference in Brussels. “The markets will adjust.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

    "content": "May 1, 2025 9:30 AM PT If you noticed the ground shaking, don’t bother checking USGS1: it’s not an earthquake, it’s just a court order upending Apple’s App Store model. Court filings often provide illuminating looks into organizations that are all too often shielded from public view, and this one is no exception. Take, for example, this fascinating nugget: \n  Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly.\n Cook choosing poorly isn’t just that he opted to side with Maestri rather than Schiller, it’s that he chose to make a risky bet. He rolled the dice on trying to hold on to as much App Store revenue as he possibly could, in the hopes that Apple would simply…get away with it. That may have worked for a while, but the bill has come due, and the end result is likely to be a significant blow to Apple’s entire App Store model.2 On a surface level, Cook’s bet would appear to be purely about the money, because isn’t it always? (CFO Luca Maestri being on the side of charging the commission certainly supports that idea.) But at the same time, it’s hard to imagine that flouting compliance like this was worth the few…billion, perhaps?…dollars that Apple has made via this mechanism over the last few years. Which is why I think that more than purely being a matter of bottom line, it was about exerting control. Unfortunately, the end result probably means Apple will lose even more control than it will revenue. Ultimately, though, I think this decision could be good for Apple—and especially good for its customers. Because getting rid of these long-time ridiculous measures forces  Apple to compete—which, lest we forget, was the entire point of this court case in the first place. Yes, some developers may continue to use Apple’s purchases system because it’s easy and integrated, but a good many of them will probably look at that 15-30 percent commission and think maybe it’s better to put in a little extra work to go outside the store. In that case, what’s Apple going to do? It would be bad business for the company to just keep its terms the way they are, holding onto its “my way or the highway” philosophy. I have to assume that—at the very least—it will lower the commission. Because getting 5 or 10 percent is unarguably better than zero percent. Apple could, of course, have done this long, long ago and frankly should have even before this case started. The closest they ever got was the Apple Small Business Program, which launched in 2020. While the program cut the commission for those making under the $1 million threshold, its structure always felt more beneficial to Apple. One could argue that disincentivized developers to try and make their apps popular and to generate revenue, lest they accidentally cross that threshold. The same is true in the European Union, where Apple’s attempt at recouping its investments via structures like the Core Technology Fee make it unattractive to switch away from Apple’s existing terms and thus actually have a depressive effect on developers taking chances. All of this amounts to Apple squandering the goodwill that its products have long engendered. As longtime journalist and developer Christina Warren noted on Mastodon: \n  You want to know why visionOS has no devs/apps? A big reason that I’ve long argued is that Apple abused the goodwill it had with its developer community over capricious IAP/linking strategies. Apple assumed devs needed Apple more than Apple needed devs. And for the iPhone, maybe that’s true. But for new platforms, it isn’t. When you actively kick someone every time they come to hang out, don’t be surprised when they don’t come to your house anymore.\n Yeah. Apps and developers enrich Apple’s ecosystem. They help enhance the platforms and devices, turning them into things that people want to use. But the company’s overriding behavior over the last fifteen years has been to try and squeeze those developers for everything they’re worth, using its platform control as a cudgel instead of treating them as partners. Adapt or die, the old saying goes. And though Apple might not be in danger of dying if it doesn’t make these changes—as I just wrote the chances of them ever really dying are slim—it’s still not without damage. To paraphrase the immortal words of one of our greatest heroines, the more Apple tightens its grip, the more revenue will slip through its fingers. The thing that Apple used to be so good at understanding is that the bottom line isn’t just about how the numbers add up. Apple has long been a company that prides itself on its image and its brand, and marring that, whether it be via contentious relationships with developers or seemingly bending over backwards for authoritarians, does have an effect in the long term.

    "content": "ByJanhoi McGregor  ByJanhoi McGregor,  Senior Contributor.  The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg This story was updated on April 11th with new Pixel 9a sale details.  Following the Apple iPhone 16 price drop and Samsung’s free Galaxy Watch giveaway, the Google Pixel 9 has joined in with the spring discounts. Don’t forget to hit the follow button above for the latest smartphone pricing news.  Amazon has slashed the price of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL by $204 for the 128GB option, bringing the price down to $894.99. A huge discount for the company’s top flagship model, especially considering the pricing uncertainty because of incoming trade tariffs. The base Pixel 9 has also been discounted by $151.75, bringing the price down to $647. The Pixel 9 Pro and Google Pixel 8 series, however, are still at full price. While the base Pixel 9 deal mimics an Amazon sale last month, the Pixel 9 Pro XL price is one of the biggest discounts I have seen yet. Google has typically knocked $150 off its top handset in the promotions it has run since the devices launched last August. But a straight $200 discount beats those sales comfortably. Amazon can undercut the companies that make these smartphones partly because you’re buying the phone and nothing else. While Samsung and Google will throw in some freebies, store credit or access to subscription services, Amazon’s no-thrill deals involve the device with no extras. The low price also balances Amazon’s poor trade-in valuations. Take a look at the selection of prices Amazon will pay for a used handset against Google’s pricing below (which itself is distinctly average). Google is only beaten on the Apple handset. Note that Amazon doesn’t accept any Google devices beyond the Pixel 5. If you want the best possible price for your old phone, you might be better off selling it on the secondary market. Even with all of the fees and rigmarole that entails. If now is not the right time to pick up a new Pixel phone, Amazon, Google and other retailers will discount the Google Pixel 9 series again, especially as we inch closer to the Pixel 10 release this summer. Update Friday 11th April: Google has officially launched the Pixel 9a and with it a slew of new promotions. First up, the Search company is giving away a $100 store credit with Pixel 9a purchases. Crucially, this can’t be used on the handset itself, rather towards your next buy. Buyers can pick up the Pixel Buds A-series for $99, which is clearly the intention behind that offer. As we have seen before with Samsung, budget wearables are a good makeweight in deals like this. Google has also upped its trade-in prices for your old phone. The company says you can pick up the Pixel 9a for as little as $99 with the right trade-in. That, of course, means handing over a Pixel 8 Pro, or Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. You can get the new phone for free if you swap in the original Pixel Fold or iPhone 15 Pro Max. A slightly more realistic trade-in is the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is worth $405, but that still feels like a downgrade to me. None of these phones should be traded in for the Pixel 9a. More sensical deals include $200 for the Pixel 7a, $280 for the iPhone 14 and $180 for the Pixel 6 Pro.

    "content": "A hot potato: A federal judge in California has delivered a decisive blow to Apple's longstanding control over its App Store, ordering the tech giant to immediately halt practices that have limited competition and maintained high commissions on app sales. This ruling concludes a five-year legal battle initiated by Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, which challenged Apple's dominance in the digital app marketplace.  Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, presiding over the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, found that Apple willfully violated a previous court order designed to open the App Store to greater competition. The federal judge's ruling delivered a sharp and unmistakable rebuke to Apple, making clear her frustration with the company's repeated defiance of court orders. Judge Rogers criticized Apple's response to her earlier injunction, which had directed the company to allow developers to steer users to external payment options, bypassing Apple's standard 30 percent commission. Instead of complying, Apple implemented a new system that required apps using external payment links to pay a 27 percent commission. The company also introduced pop-up warnings to discourage users from making payments outside the App Store, suggesting such transactions might not be secure. Judge Rogers wrote, \"Apple aimed to sustain a revenue stream worth billions in blatant violation of this court's injunction.\" We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.\n\nEpic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv The judge's frustration was evident. She accused Apple executives of dishonesty, specifically naming Alex Roman, Apple's Vice President of Finance, for \"outright lying\" to the court about when the company decided to impose the new 27 percent fee. Judge Rogers stated that neither Apple nor its legal team corrected what she called \"obvious lies,\" and she referred the matter to federal prosecutors to consider criminal contempt charges against both Roman and the company. She also criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook, saying, \"Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.\" The ruling prohibits Apple from collecting commissions on sales made outside the App Store and from enacting policies preventing developers from directing users to external payment methods. Apple is also forbidden from displaying messages that might dissuade users from purchasing outside its platform. Judge Rogers emphasized, \"Apple will not impede competition\" and that \"the court will not tolerate further delays.\" The outcome not only signals a major victory for Epic Games but also opens the door for sweeping changes in how developers and consumers interact with the digital marketplace.  Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney welcomed the decision, stating, \"There will be considerable opportunities for developers to secure better deals and for consumers to benefit as well. This is a fantastic day for everyone involved.\" Apple expressed strong disagreement with the ruling. \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order, and we will appeal,\" said Apple spokeswoman Olivia Dalton. The legal saga began in 2020, when Epic Games accused Apple of stifling competition by forcing developers to use its payment system and taking up to a 30 percent cut of many transactions. The App Store is a major revenue source for Apple, accounting for a significant portion of its nearly $100 billion in annual services revenue. While Apple initially avoided being labeled a monopoly, the court found it had violated California's competition laws by blocking alternative payment options for developers. Wednesday's ruling is expected to reshape the app economy, potentially allowing developers to retain more earnings and reducing fees that have long flowed to Apple. The decision also paves the way for Fortnite's return to the iOS App Store in the United States, after being removed in 2020 when Epic enabled alternative payment methods within the game. As the dust settles, Judge Rogers left the door open for further action, stating, \"It will be up to the executive branch to determine if Apple should face consequences for its violations, in addition to any penalties aimed at preventing future misconduct.\" \nAbout\nEthics Statement\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nManage Ad Consent\n TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark and may not be used by third parties \n without express written permission.

However, in the United States, lobbying with the government and lawmakers is actually legal. There are even companies and individuals who can willingly do that for you in exchange for a sum of money. Companies, particularly those in the tech industry, engage in lobbying to safeguard their interests and ensure that upcoming legislation aligns with their business goals. The scale of lobbying by these tech giants is significant, with substantial amounts of money being invested in these efforts. OpenSecrets, a website that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, has published detailed reports about lobbying efforts by some Big Tech firms. Let’s see how much these giant tech firms have spent on lobbying in 2024: Apple Inc: Meta: Microsoft Corp:  Amazon:  OpenAI: Alphabet Inc: Samsung Group: What do you think about corporations lobbying the government? Should this process be made illegal? \n\nPradeep Viswanathan\n                                                ·\n                    \nApr 29, 2025\n\nwith\n27\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n \n\nPaul Hill\n                                                ·\n                    \nJun 20, 2024\n\nwith\n29\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n \n\nJohn Callaham\n                                                ·\n                    \nMay 7, 2024\n\nwith\n18\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n \n\nPaul Hill\n                                                ·\n                    \nJul 27, 2023\n\nwith\n8\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n Login or Sign Up to read and post a comment.

In this episode, we dive into the rising financial pressures facing working parents today. From the skyrocketing costs of childcare, school supplies, summer camps, and college tuition to the everyday expenses of raising a family – the financial burden has never been higher.  We speak with Kendra Cole, a PR professional and mother of three, about the crippling costs of summer camps across the U.S., with families shelling out thousands of dollars just to cover the school summer vacation.  Meanwhile, wages haven’t kept pace with inflation, leaving many parents stretched thin as they try to provide stability for their children. In 2023, the national average price of care for one child in the U.S. was $11,582 which averages out to $965 per month. For families with more than one child, that can be more than their rent or mortgage payment. We speak with MarketWatch personal finance reporter Venessa Wong on how parents are going into credit card debt to cover costs. And how she herself feels the pressure to start saving for her kids’ college education before they reach high school.  Many people have pushed back on returning to the office for more days because they’ve molded their work and personal lives around a more hybrid, flexible schedule for the last 5 years. Some employers are assisting with that transition better than others. Companies like Walmart, P&G and Cisco offer on-site childcare at some offices and back-up childcare services for working parents. They do so by partnering with Bright Horizons. We speak with Priya Krishnan, chief transformation officer of Bright Horizons, about how employers are trying to bolster their benefits to help offset some of these stressors.

As Roblox and companies in the platform’s ecosystem continue to grapple with proving its advertising potential to brands, Super League’s acquisition of Supersocial could signal a coming wave of consolidation among these types of companies.
